The reference for CloudFormation shared-templates from BriteCloud has changed to a new bucket reference that includes the stage name. Existing CloudFormation templates for the service teams need to be updated to reference the new bucket in order to take advantage of new features and bug-fixes in shared templates. References to `CloudFormationTemplatesBucketURL` that join with the development directory are from BriteDevelopment and should be left as is (those templates were not moved).

Example of **old** syntax
```
Fn::Join:
- ""/""
- - Fn::ImportValue: CloudFormationTemplatesBucketURL
  - deployment
  - aurora-cluster
  - 1.0.yaml
```
Example of the **new** syntax (be sure to pay close attention to the directory structure)

2,13378,Validate condition selectors according to statement possibilities,feature,cristiano@britecore.com,,"## Overview

The condition field in a PolicyStatement can express references to the context of both the evaluated $record and $action. Moreover, attributes of those two selector roots can be defined, such as $record.size or $action.type. 

Since those selectors are created by humans, a mistake can be made such that the attribute on the selector does not make sense to the respective resource or action.

## Success Condition

* Prevent conditions with inconsistent selectors to be persisted in the database.


## Note

Continuous relational integrity can't be enforced by the relational database for the condition field since it is a JSON field, so we will need to account for that as we mature domain evolution.

The domains app is currently coupled with the policies app, due to the need to automatically create a ResourceSpec instance when an Organization, Domain, or Resource is created or an ActionSpec instance when an Action is created.

This coupling happens in the save method Organization, Domain, Resource, and Action.

To decrease direct coupling, we should check the feasibility of using Django signals

Attempting to reach out to statement actions using an instance `.actions` attribute can be misleading. Since that attribute represents a ManyToMany relationship with domains.Action through an intermediate table, whenever the FK in the intermediate table is set to null, then the respective item will not be listed by PolicyStatement.actions.

The Lexis Nexis National Credit File (NCF) provides online consumer credit reports to insurance carriers. The financial history of the applicant can be considered as part of assessing risk for quoting and underwriting purposes. NCF supports a common inquiry and results format for credit information obtained from the three major credit bureaus.

BriteCore has an integration for LexisNexis Credit already which is being used by Augusta on their live site.   The Credit Score can be found on the Named Insured contact page where it lists their score and the date the report was pulled.  This is stored in the Credit Reports table under `dateAdded` and `score`.  The `contactId` equals the `id` on the Contact table.

The Credit Score is only needed for the Primary Driver.  If it is available, Augusta would like to use the homeowners credit score, however, the credit score can only be used if it is less than 90 days old.

 Notes
 --------

 
  * We need to consider policy type and report date (aka Today) in filtering the search to determine if a policy is inforce at the time. For per occurrence policies date of loss must fall within the policy term but the report that can be after the policy term has lapsed. For claims made policies the date of loss has fall within the policy term or the tail coverage of the policy and report date must be within the policy term

As an Adjuster, I want to be able to must be convert lump sum reserve to itemized reserve if information to set up itemized reserve for the coverage is available so that more accurate amount of money can be allocated using coverage, claimant and loss/damage details.
Example:
Initial reserve: $10.000 lump sum reserve at claim level as coverages didn't match during the FNOL.
During claim management process 2 new coverages are added to the claim and manually matched.
The lump sum reserve is converted to itemized reserves as follows:
Scenario 1:
Coverage A - Loss Reserve: $5000
Coverage B - Loss Reserve: $2000

New reserve Setup:
Itemized Reserve Line 1: $5000
Itemized Reserve Line 2: $2000
Lump Sum Reserve: $3000

Scenario 2:
$3000 Expense Invoice received.

New Reserve Setup:
Itemized Reserve Line 1: $5000
Itemized Reserve Line 2: $2000
Expense Reserve: $3000
Lump Sum Reserve: $0

Description o f Pro-Rate: The ceding company and reinsured share premium and losses on specific risks in proportion to an agreed percentage.

Example 1
Commercial Umbrella Policy Limit $1,000,000
Annual Premium $10,000

The ceding company retains 25% net and places 75% facultative reinsurance on a pro rata basis. Reinsurance participation is expressed as $750,000 (75%) part of $1,000,000.

Losses
If a covered loss of $400,000 occurs, the ceding company would pay $100,000 (25% of $400,000), and the reinsurer would pay $300,000 (75% of $400,000).

Example 2
Restaurant/Hotel, 100% PML (Probable Maximum Loss)
Buildings $ 10,000,000
Contents $ 2,000,000
Total Insurable Value (TIV) $ 12,000,000
Annual Premium $ 20,000

Because of potential high severity of loss from a burn-out situation (100% PML), pro rata protection is appropriate. If the ceding company’s net retention is 80% and a reinsurer participates at 20%, a 20% pro rata protection on each and every loss will result.

Losses
Assuming a loss of $9,000,000, the ceding company would pay 80%, or $7,200,000, and the reinsurer would pay 20%, or $1,800,000.",,2018/06/11 3:25:19,,2018/06/11 3:25:19,2018/06/11 3:25:19,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,Unscheduled,3671,BriteClaims - Reinsurance,844,BriteClaims,-5:00:00,Claims

Excess of loss facultative placements require an analysis of potential severity of losses. The ceding company selects a loss level compatible with net and treaty guidelines and uses this as its retention. The facultative reinsurer provides a limit of reinsurance in excess of this retention.

Example 1

Commercial Umbrella Policy Limit $ 1,000,000
Annual Premium $ 10,000
Assume the ceding company also writes a $1,000,000 underlying policy. Its net and treaty retention may be limited to $1,250,000 per risk. Since the total combined limit of the two policies is $2,000,000, the reinsurance cover is excess of the net and treaty retention, expressed as $750,000 excess $250,000 excess underlying ($1,000,000)

Example 2

Restaurant/Hotel, Fire Resistive 4-story Office Building (2-story PML)
Building $ 10,000,000
Contents $ 2,000,000
Total Insurable Value (TIV) $ 12,000,000
PML $ 6,000,000
Annual Premium $ 20,000
Because loss severity is not expected (note PML estimate above), excess protection may be the most cost-efficient solution. If the ceding company retains the PML net and facultatively reinsures the remaining limit on an excess basis, the layering and possible price allocation might look like this:
Ceding company:
$6,000,000 Net $15,000 Premium
Facultative Reinsurer:
$6,000,000 excess $6,000,000 $5,000 Net Premium
Assuming a loss of $9,000,000, the facultative reinsurer pays $3,000,000 excess of the ceding company’s $6,000,000 first dollar retention.

Example 3

Assume an insurer needs capacity to write casualty business of $1,000,000 in order to compete in its market niche. Because it is a small company, it determines that it can retain the first $300,000 loss on any risk. However, it needs reinsurance to apply to that part of any loss that exceeds the retained limit of $300,000. In this example, an excess of loss treaty would be expressed as $700,000 x/s $300,000.
Assume each of these risks is written by the insurer for a limit of $1,000,000.
Risk A
Has a loss of $600,000.
The insurer pays the first $300,000 (retention) and the reinsurer the remaining $300,000.
Risk B
Has a loss of $250,000.
The insurer pays the entire loss with no indemnification by the reinsurer as the loss is within the retention of $300,000.
Risk C
Has a loss of $1,000,000. The insurer pays the first $300,000 (retention) and the reinsurer, $700,000.",,2018/06/11 3:31:02,,2018/06/11 3:44:10,2018/06/11 3:31:02,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,Unscheduled,3671,BriteClaims - Reinsurance,844,BriteClaims,-5:00:00,Claims

Example
The ceding company has a 60% quota share treaty. Therefore, 40% of all premiums and losses will be retained by the company and 60% of all premiums (less commission) and losses will be ceded to the reinsurer subject to the limit of the
treaty. The commission to the ceding company is agreed upon at 30%.

Losses
Assume a total loss of $400,000 occurs. For this loss, the ceding company would pay $160,000 (40% of $400,000) and the reinsurer would pay $240,000 (60% of $400,000).",,2018/06/11 3:31:49,,2018/06/11 3:31:49,2018/06/11 3:31:49,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,Unscheduled,3671,BriteClaims - Reinsurance,844,BriteClaims,-5:00:00,Claims

Under a surplus share type of treaty, the pro rata proportion ceded depends on the size and type of risk. The ceding company has the right to decide how much it wants to retain on any one risk. This retention is called a “line.” Any risk that falls within this retention or line is handled totally by the primary company. Whenever the company insures a risk that is larger than the retention, the amount over the retention is ceded to the surplus share treaty as a multiple of the retention. All losses between the insurer’s retention on the risk and reinsurer’s participation are pro rated.
Since the ceding company decides how much of each risk it will cede to the treaty, the particular percentage between the insurer and reinsurer will vary.
This concept differs from a quota share treaty where the percentage is fixed between the insurer and the reinsurer’s participation, for all risks.

Example
Assume the minimum retention or line is $50,000. The limit of the treaty is then expressed as a multiple of the line. A 9-line surplus treaty would be (9 x $50,000) or $450,000. The total capacity to the insurer is $500,000.
Any risk with a value of $50,000 or less is retained and not ceded to the treaty. For risks greater than $50,000, the insurer determines how many lines it will retain above the $50,000 and how many lines will be ceded up to the $450,000 limit.
Risk A
A low hazard risk with a limit of $350,000. The insurer may retain 5 lines or $250,000 and cede 2 lines or $100,000 to the treaty.
Risk B
A moderate hazard risk with a limit of $400,000. The insurer may retain 3 lines or $150,000 and cede 5 lines or $250,000 to the treaty.
Risk C
A high hazard risk with a limit of $500,000. The insurer may retain 2 lines or $100,000 and cede 8 lines or $400,000 to the treaty.",,2018/06/11 3:32:58,,2018/06/11 3:32:58,2018/06/11 3:32:58,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,Unscheduled,3671,BriteClaims - Reinsurance,844,BriteClaims,-5:00:00,Claims

455,4070,Set Adjuster's Reserve Authority Level,feature,morgan.cassady@britecore.com,,"## Set Adjuster's Reserve Authority Level


**Feature Request -**

We need some way to set authority levels for adjusters on reserves and payments. To do this, we need a way to say for each user role, the authority limits for cov_a, cov_b, cov_c, etc. are set to a specific level both payments and reserves. You could represent this with a sample data object like the following:

'user_role_1': [
  'cov_a': {
    'payment_authority': 5000,
    'reserver_authority': 5000
  },
  'cov_b': {
    'payment_authority': 2000,
    'reserver_authority': 3000
  },
  'cov_c': {
    'payment_authority': 10000,
    'reserver_authority': 12000
  },
]

Given a small data set, this would be manageable. However, in a real system, there are many lines of business with potentially hundreds of coverages in each line of business. This is further complicated by the fact that available coverages change over time. In BriteCore we manage these coverage changes by effective date.

Building a system that continually syncs all the potential coverages across all product definition systems across all effective dates for the purpose of setting and maintaining authority limits is a large undertaking. An alternative to this strategy would be to set authority limits by some kind of pattern match. I suggested potentially matching by RegEx on the Coverage Name. This would look more like the following for a wildcard policy:

'user_role_1': {
  '\*\': {
    'payment_authority': 5000,
    'reserver_authority': 5000
  }

This would match all coverages \*\ to this policy.",,2018/06/29 22:37:59,,2018/08/14 5:33:03,2018/06/29 22:37:59,,,FALSE,FALSE,"BriteClaims_BC_Parity_Plus

* The search bar, so the adjuster can search for a claim - 
* The search bar execute ""Search"" button if the user changes the search criteria and wants to execute another search. The search button executes the search in a new tab window,

I would like to be able to see that those conditions exist when on the Claim Summary table by looking at the Exposure table.

SOLUTION: Provide a  hazard symbol on the Exposure next to each condition on the Risk Card with the words “Unassigned” under the Coverage Column, and/or under the Adjuster column.

Also provide the hazard symbol in the Group header to indicate this condition exists for risks associated with the header when the tree structure is closed. 

Example: 
In the link below, the Claimant Glenda Tusing has 2 exposures. One of them is the Honda Civic which was added through the FNOL process.  The coverage level Adjuster has not been assigned nor has the Coverage.  The Hazard symbol shows in 3 places, next to Glenda’s Name in the Grouping header, under Coverage, and Under Adjuster. 

As these conditions are cleared at the Exposure level, the hazard symbols go away. When all hazard symbols are gone on all exposures under the Group Header, in this case for Glenda, then remove the hazard symbol next to Glenda.

521,5923,UI - Display Driver/Vehicle options to Agent,feature,amy@britecore.com,,"**Business Goals**
Quoting will display the list of drivers & vehicles returned from AutoData Prefill for the Agent to accept/reject.

AutoData Prefill will return Drivers and Vehicles along with Current Carrier information.  
Breakdown of what is returned:
Drivers - can return multiple
- Driver First, Middle, Last name
- Driver DOB
- Driver Gender
- Driver SSN
- Address - House #, Street Name, City, State, Zip Code
- Driver License #
- Driver License type, state, number, issue date, expiration date

Current Carrier
- Carrier Name
- Inception Date
- Status (status of the policy)
- Subject Name
- Relationship Code (A1 = Primary, L1 = Listed, E1 = Excluded, B1 = Secondary, G1 = Employee, H1 = Other) . Subject Name and Relationship Code will help with driver assignment.
- Limits BI/PD - used for default values
- Limits UM/UN - used for default values.

- VIN, model year, make, vehicle type, business use indicator --> this information is used for VINMASTER
- Lien Holder Name
- Lien Holder Address

The Agent needs the ability to accept or reject the Drivers and Vehicles so BriteLines knows which ones to create.  This also gives the Agent a chance to verify which Vehicle Type Risk Group the Vehicle should be created under in the case it is not returned correctly (ex.  returns as Private Passenger, but it is really an Antique Auto).  

Additional note:  The vehicle type field is decoded from the VIN.  If we are not able to decode the VIN, then the vehicle returns as Unknown.  Vehicle type Unknown typically includes vehicles like trailers, golf carts, ATVs, antiques, snowmobiles or other ‘toys’.  Antiques typically do not have a standardized VIN which is able to be decoded.

Motorhomes can return as a vehicle type Truck.  The Body Style field will return a ‘Motorized Home’ in these instances. 

The Agent would be able to verify or pick the Risk Group for the Vehicles, but they would need to be prompted.

1. Click the ellipsis icon on the row of the exposure I would like to Void

2. If Payments have been made on the Coverage (that have not been moved)

SOLUTION: 
From the Exposure table click the ellipsis icon of an Open Exposure  you want to close and select ""Close Exposure"".  This option will only appear of the Exposure status is Open.


Please see the Invision Link to start the workflow (Click on the word ""Close"" will take you to the flow if there are open reserves, clicking  ""Exposure"" will take . you to the flow where there are no reserves): 

https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/13966624/314088708/preview

**Workflow If there are Open Reserves:**
- Pop up a message that says ""Please zero the reserves before closing the exposure"" (In the future we will change this to ask ""You currently have open reserves on this exposure. Would you like to automatically zero the reserves before closing the exposure?""---and   have a business rule do it)

https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/13966624/316121610/preview

**Workflow If there are no Open Reserves**
- Provide a Pop screen that asks ""Please provide reason for closing the Exposure"".   Provide the ability to select from a drop down list of reasons or free form text entry.  Reasons will include: Exposure was closed with payment, Exposure was closed with out paymentSettled, etc.  This should be a configurable reference table for the system administrator.
- Once the reason has been entered, select the ""Close Exposure"" button
- Close the Exposure
- If this is the last Exposure present a message that states ""All exposures for this claim have been closed. Would you like to close the claim?""  Provide 2 buttons...""Cancel"", and ""Close Claim""
- Exposure on Exposure Table should now show a Status of ""Closed""....Claim should also be closed if it was the last Exposure and you chose to Close the Claim too.

This is not a change that would happen on a policy, rather one claim at a time.  Financial authority limit rules will be governed by this change

In a small claims shop the adjuster may be given authority to make this change. In a larger claims shop, the adjuster will need to request approval for the change and a supervisor will need to approve it.  Suggested workflow would be: 

1) Select Coverage to increase limit
2) Manually input Amount coverage is increasing to
3) Select from a drop down list reason for making the change (OOSA-Out of State Accident, Litigation/Judgement, Other)
4) Saving the change puts an indicator on the coverage showing there is a requested change
5)  Supervisor recieves Task to approve coverage change
6) When Supervisor approves it, on the Policy Modal the indicator now shows there has been a change to the coverage limit allowing the adjuster to see  original value and the new value
7) Entry is made in the audit log/Notepad that this change was made and why, who requested it and who approved it.

Provide the ability to filter the list of adjusters by one or more of the following attributes:
- Adjuster Name (text entry)
- Adjuster Caseload - this will filter from information on the Adjuster Profile also

- Show in Office Only
  -In/out of Office- Based on the Adjusters User Profile, If out of the office (vacation, sick, travelling, etc), automatically exclude from the list.  We will ultimately need to synch to a calendar that is either in an HR system like Bamboo (WCF) or Office 360 (AFR) for this information.  Both the Supervisor and Adjuster need to be able to set in/out of office for day setting on User Profile for this to work.
- Adjuster Location- City/State - this will be from the Adjusters profile based on the physical location of the adjuster's office
- Language Ability
- Complexity/Severity Handling Ability

585,7021,UI - Ask the Agent if they have permission to pull credit,feature,amy@britecore.com,,"**Business Goad**

The Agent needs to be questioned regarding permission to pull the Insured's credit.  Currently in BriteCore, this is already in place for Augusta's other lines of business. (see attached screen shot).  The same wording should be used.  This prompt is set up under the vendor section of classic BC for Lexis Nexis Credit.

There are three scenarios:
- If agent indicates “yes” then we should be automatically pulling the score for the primary policyholder without the agent needing to click “Get Credit Score” or anything further. 
- If agent indicates “no” then that should halt the quote process.  
- If a score is re-used that has been previously pulled - within the past 90 days, we will not need to ask agent the permission question.  This step could be skipped.


**User Story**

There are certain violations returned from MVR or entered by the Agent that would cause Augusta to just stop the quote.  They do not want these risks and it is considered a Knockout.  Give a message to the user that the Violation/DUI/Filing is not eligible. (see wording in referral message column)

For two of these rules, the tier that the quote is in determines what is acceptable or what is considered a knockout.

This rule needs the connection to MVR to be working to fully test.  In the meantime, manually entered driver violations can be used to initially test.  These rules need to take both manually entered and MVR returned violations into account.

621,7761,COMP losses count Knockout with Override,feature,amy@britecore.com,"nicolas.gomez@britecore.com
demian@britecore.com","**Business Goals**
For New Business, if there are more than 2 Comprehensive losses within the past 36 months (excludes towing) entered from either the Agent/user or returned from CLUE, a message should go to the user saying they are referred to UW - with the text in the Referral Message column.  The Agent should be able to continue quoting, but only be allowed too submit unbound.  The UW can later go in and look at it.

For Renewals, it is the same thing, it is just looking at what CLUE previously had returned since Renewals doesn't call CLUE again.  It should also include any claims comprehensive losses added.

This applies regardless of the tier level.

Questions?
- What is considered a Comprehensive loss?  
   - It would be Accident and Violation Risk Group field Type = `Comprehensive Loss (Animal, Glass, Other)`
- What is this count counting?  
   - This count should be for the full policy.  So if Driver 1 has 1 comprehensive loss and Driver 2 has 2 comprehensive losses in the last 36 months, that total is 3 for the policy and should fail this rule since no more than 2 should be in last 36 months.
- How do we know if claims added a comp loss?  
   - Great question - figuring that out with the claims team.
- How do we exclude towing?  
   - Towing has been added as a separate option to chose under Type.  So for this rule, just need to count that `Comprehensive Loss (Animal, Glass, Other)` type.  Ignore the others for this count.

Based on the Tier and the Violation returned by MVR/entered by the Agent, Augusta has some combinations that they consider Knockouts.  This means they want the Referral Message shown to the user and not allow them to continue with the quote because they do not want the risk.

Example - Tier = Standard or Preferred, cannot have any 'Speeding 20 mph or more' in the past 36 months and only 1 in the past 37-60 months.  If have more than 1 in 37-60 month timespan or 1+ in the past 36 months, knockout - do not want the risk.

Based on the Tier and the Violation returned by MVR/entered by the Agent, Augusta has some combinations that they would like the system to downgrade the tier if it will keep it from knocking out.  If it will knockout regardless of the tier, they would like to just knock it out then.  There is no message if the system downgrades, it just would change the tier and keep going with the quote.  If we cannot downgrade the tier, then we would show the Referral Message to the user and not allow them to continue with the quote because Augusta does not want the risk.

There are three tiers (from best to worst) - Elite, Preferred, Standard.

Example - If type is preferred, you can only have 1 `Speeding 20 mph or more` in the past 60 months.  If the insured has more than 1 in  60 months, but only 1 in the past 36 months, they still qualify for the Standard tier.  However, if they have more than 1 in the past 36 months of this violation, then the system has to knock them out - display message to user and stop the quote from moving forward.

Based on the Tier and the Vehicle Information, Augusta has some combinations that they would like the system to refer to underwriting. They would like the message displayed to the user and still let them finish the quote if they want, but submit unbound. It should not be a hard knockout like in other situations. Then it will be reviewed by Underwriting.

There are three tiers (from best to worst) - Elite, Preferred, Standard.

Example - Ineligible or restricted vehicle list.  If the vehicle is on the list, it needs to be referred to underwriting - message the Agent, allow them to finish the quote, submit unbound and have an underwriter review.

UW Rules
There are two UW rules listed in the Augusta Rules document that looks at the vehicle and knockouts at this time: 14.a, and 14.b.",,2018/10/08 13:55:29,,2018/10/08 14:01:24,2018/10/08 13:55:29,,,FALSE,FALSE,Client_Augusta,,Unscheduled,7723,Augusta Underwriting Rules,56,BriteRules,-5:00:00,Rules

Idea from Zach Rucker - Cameron Mutual
https://britecore.slack.com/archives/C72RNQWAC/p1539023874000100?thread_ts=1539019561.000100&cid=C72RNQWAC

I had a spark of an idea. Hopefully someone brighter than me can run with it. Maybe it is already on the road map. My idea assumes max capacity is defined manually within the system based off subjective data such as max number of open assigned claims or risks, number of open complex claims assigned, number of open claims with reserves above X dollars, etc. However, max capacity will vary by adjuster, by role, or expertise. A system that can recognize when adjuster has reached their personal max capacity based off performance metrics and then assign only claims of a certain complexity or even defer assignments completely to that adjuster would be flashy. I envision a system that is able to evaluate an adjuster's claim closing ratio, closing velocity, open tasks, task completion rate, distribution of open claim complexity types, and speed and efficiency of claim investigations for example.

During the 8.9.18 Augusta Cell meeting, we discussed how the  flow would work for the user before calling AutoData Prefill.

The flow - 
Start with policy 
Add primary driver (w/o leaving policy) by clicking like a `+` to add driver.  
Fill out fields.  
Once have the information filled in, click a button to continue which would run Auto Data Prefill.

The button may say `Auto Data Prefill` or `Next` which run Auto Data Prefill.  Or something else that will be calling AutoData Prefill when it is clicked.  Need to discuss this will Will/Design team on what would make the most sense here - see related story (6213).

**The information that is needed to go to LexisNexis:**
The following is required to be sent to Auto Data Prefill:
• First Name
• Last Name
• Current address - Sent as house #, Street, City, State, and Postal Code (first 5)

The following is recommended, but not required to order Auto Data - get better results if at least send the SSN and any other optional fields :
• SSN (Social Security number)
• DOB (date of birth)
• Driver license number
• Driver license issuing state

This is from the Primary Driver.  As stated above with the flow, the Agent would add this driver as they are starting the policy.

As an Agent, I want to start a policy, enter in the Primary Driver and have it go to Auto Data Prefill so that any other drivers, vehicles and current carrier information would be returned and I don't have to fill it out manually.

demian@britecore.com","**Background**
The insurance score should be hidden from the Agent, but visible to the Admin.  In addition, the field should be marked somehow (in red) to signal to the Admin that that field is hidden from the Agent.  The reason the Admin needs it is so they can use that field for audit/debugging purposes.

**Behavioral Rule**
Rule 30",,2018/11/05 11:58:38,,2018/11/05 11:58:38,2018/11/05 11:58:38,,,FALSE,FALSE,Client_Augusta,,Unscheduled,7722,Augusta Behavioral Rules,56,BriteRules,-5:00:00,Rules
661,8350,"Fields should read-only for Agent, read-write for Admin",feature,amy@britecore.com,"nicolas.gomez@britecore.com
demian@britecore.com","**Background**
The are some fields that will show up on the dec, so the Agent should be able to see them on the quote.  However, the Agent should not be able to edit them.  These fields should be read-only for the Agent.  The Admin should have read-write option on these fields.

The fields that this impacts are the comprehensiveSymbol and collisionSymbol that are set by VINMASTER.  If VINMASTER is wrong or can't find the symbols, the Admin may need to manually fix them.  Values from VINMASTER should be Read only to the Agent, but read-write to the Admin.  Augusta does not want the Agent to override the values VINMASTER sets.

For all risk types, this would mean
- `comprehensiveSymbol` 
- `collisionSymbol` 
- `program`  (which is the reference name for Tier)

For just Private Passenger Auto Risk Type
- `passiveRestraint`
- `hasAntiLock`

These should be read-only for the Agent. These values are on the dec, so the Agent can see them, but the system determines them and the Agent should not be able to change them - the Admin can make changes to these fields.

**Behavioral Rules**
Rule 31.

As a carrier, I want to make values set by VINMASTER read-only for the Agent while allowing the Admin to make changes so that the Agent doesn't override the values.",,2018/11/05 12:04:38,,2019/03/29 8:41:21,2018/11/05 12:04:38,,,FALSE,FALSE,Client_Augusta,,Unscheduled,7722,Augusta Behavioral Rules,56,BriteRules,-5:00:00,Rules

I would like the following screens to ask a question “Is the party involved in the claim?” and provide 2 radio buttons (or drop down list) Yes or No.  This question should be placed above the Role drop down list.

706,9753,(Discussion) Re-evluate BriteAuth Token Storage Medium,chore,myles@britecore.com,,"**Topic**
From both functional and security standpoints, we need to re-evaluate the token storage medium used by BriteAuth.

The Cognito SDK written by AWS prefers local storage, but we ultimately converted to cookie storage to more easily integrate with BriteCore Classic (Generation 2).

The security world seems somewhat conflicted on which medium is better with many recommendations to never store tokens in the client at all.

On top of that, we've already nearly reached the maximum size allowable for cookies, so this may not even be an option for long.

For some more context, see [this PR review](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore-UI/pull/792#pullrequestreview-184418894) and [this Slack discussion](https://britecore.slack.com/archives/CBTLU6Q1J/p1543463733007500)

If a name is misspelled in a minor way, LN will return an error:
<message type=""""Miscellaneous"""">POSSIBLE MVR MISMATCH, PLEASE REVIEW TO VERIFY: FN</message>""

Since names are mostly returned by Auto Data Prefill, it is possible that this error may not happen often, but we need to handle it if it does. For example, Agent adds in another driver.

This is Test # 31 in the MVR test cases:
""To test, use a valid test case, but vary the spelling of 1 or more items in a minor way, such as Jonathan to Johnathan. (Do not vary the state postal code or DL number in the test data spreadsheet.)

Middle: G
Last: Babuca
DL#: A69629132 . State: VA
DOB: 9/28/64""

As seen in the linked stories, LN MVR will return the indicator and there is a field on the driver for the indicator.  This story is for that piece that will take the indicator from what is returned from LN MVR and set the field on the driver from it.  

The setting of the mismatch indicator would have to set it every time, so it would get reset.  For example, there is a mismatch, the indicator is set to True.  The Agent fixes the problem.  Resends the request to MVR.  MVR finds it this time, the indicator would need to be set back to No so that it doesn't trigger a message again.

**User Story**
As a Carrier, I want the value returned from LN MVR to set the value of the indicator on the Driver so that I can tell if there is a mismatch.

744,10879,BriteLines - Consider Removing/Replacing Cancel & Save Changes buttons.,feature,chelsea.ux@britecore.com,,"Consider removing or replacing the ""Cancel"" and ""Save Changes"" buttons since it seems that they neither save changes nor cancel changes, but merely exit out of the item after the changes have already been saved.

This issue originated from Content Analyst feedback.  Slack convo:
https://britecore.slack.com/archives/C7G9SFBE3/p1547837632341900

Feedback:
""However, my one issue is the “Cancel” button - it’s really just an exit button, but having it named “Cancel” implies that you can _undo_ the changes that were already saved. The combination of the “Save Changes” and “Cancel” buttons both being present implies that the changes _aren’t_ saving as I go, and that I must press “Save Changes” to save the item and “Cancel” to cancel the changes. As far as I know, the function of both of those buttons is identical - they neither save changes nor cancel changes, but merely exit out of the item after the changes have already been saved (since they save whenever I click off them).

Also, if we’re removing the save changes and cancel buttons, it’d probably be good to have an exit button instead, just so that there’s still some obvious/easy way to exit an item without clicking the back button on the browser (since that’s not intuitive in my opinion)""",,2019/01/18 14:46:00,,2019/01/20 12:11:13,2019/01/18 14:46:00,,,FALSE,FALSE,"BriteLines

Request BriteAccess to perform evaluations will need a request to be composed by sibling products, server side. The request will typically be performed as the effect of another data domain-specific request, and it can spawn multiple different requests towards BriteAccess.

Composing these requests are expected to vary on a per-case basis, but patterns will probably emerge from typical use cases, and some automation may be provided, maybe to install default behavior as configurable middlewares or maybe by providing these facilities at the infrastructure level, to spare services to trouble of being called just realize the request violates some authorization constraint.

758,11241,Augusta quotes valid for 60 days,feature,amy@britecore.com,,"**Background**
We had a discussion with Augusta concerning how long a quote should be valid for the Agent.  

Augusta would like the quote to be valid for 60 days for the Agents.  The insurance score is good for 90 days and the other vendor called information also would not need to be re-ordered during that 60 day window.  This 60 day window gives the Agent a chance to go in and out of the quote with only ordering from each vendor a max of one time, since it costs money for each time you order from a vendor.

Potential problem:  LexisNexis does periodic audits of agents and carriers to verify that MVR's are ordered for legitimate purposes only and agent/carrier needs to show a quote or in force policy related to an ordered MVR.  

Due to this potential audit, when a quote is no longer valid for an Agent, it needs to be accessible by the Admin/underwriter.  

It was discussed that the Archive functionality in BriteCore Gen 2 could be used to address this problem.  However, the archive functionality is only on committed revisions.  These quotes that are over 60 days old, would not be committed.  If you try to archive a policy with a single, uncommitted revision, it will actually delete it.

There is existing functionality on the Velocity branch for BriteCore Gen 2.  They have a setting for Quote Expiration days.
![Clipboard 2019-15-02 at 12.32.20 PM.png](https://api.clubhouse.io/api/attachments/files/clubhouse-assets/5a3c64e9-a53f-4d05-bf0f-a5c21841937e/5c6705b6-667a-4cd8-966f-40b70cae7816/Clipboard%202019-15-02%20at%2012.32.20%20PM.png)
Once a quote is expired, it will prompt the agent to contact the admin/UW to reinstate it for viewing.  It is based off the Quote Create date.  Admins can access it indefinitely, but agents can only access it for X number of days (whatever is in the setting)

Currently there is a bug in Gen 3 that allows you to resubmit a quote to Gen 2 and create a new policy in Gen 2.  Basically one quote can be resubmitted multiple times.

This bug is okay for now because it allows Augusta to create a quote in Gen 3, submit it and commit in Gen 2.  Then they are able to go back to Gen 3 and the original quote, open it, tweak a few attributes to create a similar test, then resubmit it to Gen 2.  This creates a new quote/policy in Gen 2.  The policies in Gen 2 are able to leave a trail of what has been tested if Steve needs to go back and refer to them.

Eventually, we do not want this to occur.  If a quote is created in Gen 3 and submitted to Gen 2, it should stay connected to that quote.  However, since this will aid in Augusta's testing, they would like it to be fixed before going live, but not fixed yet.

[@delisson](clubhouse://members/5a6f48c0-3f61-46a6-a5c2-ad3e2810ba6b) and I had a call last week to clarify some points concerning BriteAccess, BriteAuth and OAuth. Long story short, OAuth presents the concept of scopes, which we believe can be represented through pre-configured stock policies defined in the Domain Contribution Schema document.

That conversation introduced the following concepts:

* Managed Policies shamelessly stolen from AWS IAM, where some policies in the system are readonly and can't change by client definitions. 

* OAuth Scopes should be modeled within BriteAccess, and the mapping between scopes and policies should be configurable and visible to business users. By default the list of scopes published by a domain can be fulfilled by policies defined alongside those scope definitions, but that fulfillment may be overwritten by customer managed policies.

## Expected Outcome

* Design and document OAuth integration within BriteCore.
* Create implementation stories out of any newly acquired knowledge.",,2019/02/25 14:42:28,,2019/03/05 11:42:29,2019/02/25 14:42:28,,,FALSE,FALSE,BriteAccess,,Unscheduled,12705,BriteAccess:  BriteAuth Integration,10891,BriteAccess,-5:00:00,Access

What happens is a deactivation would be cascaded down to policies that somehow refer to those entities. So say a policy refers to an user whose group was deleted: at first thought that policy should be deactivated, as in, it should not provide its former effect anymore. Likewise, reactivating the removed entity should reactivate the policy, or somehow mark the policy as ""good for reactivation"". The problem with this approach is deactivating a denial policy as a side effect of deactivating something else is a security breach in, which means we can't implement a naive and implicit cascading solution. Instead we need a more robust mechanism to inform users about what is going on as the system data evolves.",,2019/01/25 13:08:36,,2019/05/14 17:07:10,2019/02/21 18:47:28,,2,FALSE,FALSE,,,Unscheduled,12725,BriteAccess: Configuration Versioning,10891,BriteAccess,-5:00:00,Access

815,13092,Current Carrier Rules (Behavioral 41 & 42),feature,amy@britecore.com,,"**Business Goals**
The integration with LexisNexis Auto Data Prefill will return Current Carrier information.  This is important to see for information on if there is a previous gap and information on history.

The information for the current carrier:

Carrier Name (carrierName) - string
Inception Date (inceptionDate) - date
Policy Status (policyStatus) - string""

This information will be on the Review screen following the last underwriting question, just prior to the Remarks block so the Agent sees the information when reviewing the quote. Rules will need to control if these fields are greyed out/read only to the Agent. It should also use the term 'Current Carrier'.

Behavioral Rules 41 & 42:  
- If Auto Data Prefill returns information for these fields, they should be read only.  Augusta does not want the Agent to be able to change information that was returned from LexisNexis.  
- However, if Auto Data Prefill does not return any carrier information, we need to allow the Agent to enter in the Current carrier of the Insured.  The other two fields (Inception Date and Policy Status) would remain Read-only.

Summary - If there is a value in the Carrier Name field, it should be Read-Only to the Agent.  If it is blank, it should be Read-Write.  The other two fields (inception date and policy status) would be Read-Only no matter if they have a value or not.  This is for the Agent only.  The Admin (in BriteCore Gen 2) should be able to Read-Write all fields all the time.

**User Story**
As a Carrier, I want the Current Carrier fields to all be Read-Only if they have values so that the Agent can't change the values.  

As a Carrier, I want the Carrier Name field to be Read-Write for the Agent if it is blank from LexisNexis.

**Success Conditions**
- If Auto Data Prefill returns a Current Carrier, these fields would be populated and Read-Only to the Agent.  In BriteCore Gen 2, the Admin can still make changes (fields are Read-Write)
- If Auto Data Prefill does not return a Current Carrier, these fields would be blank.  The Carrier Name would be editable by the Agent and the other two fields would be Read-Only to the Agent.

Britecore Gen 2 is not able to react to BriteDocs events because of the API authentication that is dependent on the `api_key` parameter in the request body. While we have the ability to send the `api_key` parameter in an event payload, BriteEvents request payload will send it in the `data` key resulting in an authentication failure.

After some research, I come up with a few ideas:

1) Use SNS basic authentication schema for subscription (detailed [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/sns/latest/dg/sns-http-https-endpoint-as-subscriber.html)). This would imply in a new method for authenticating API requests in BC Gen 2.

2) Create a specialized BC Gen 2 APIGateway that's able to understand BriteEvents payload. This approach would change BC urls schema by adding a new pattern [here](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore/blob/master/britecore.py#L114) and, create a new class to deal with requests coming from BriteEvents.

3) Add the ability of forwarding headers in BriteEvents and bc-events client. This would change how publishing events would happen within applications that need to integrate with BC Gen 2, instead of only set a payload we'd also be able to send headers that we want to forward to our destination when the endpoint protocol is `http` or `https`.

Not sure if there are better alternatives so, I'm creating this story as space for discussion since other teams will probably need this integration as well.",,2019/03/20 13:30:31,,2019/03/20 13:31:10,2019/03/20 13:30:31,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,Unscheduled,,,6,BriteDocs,-5:00:00,Docs

There’s an issue that causes unexpected behavior when validating a second vehicle on Quote Flow.

Steps to reproduce:

0. Make sure you have BriteRules enabled.
1. Create a quote in: <https://localhost:4443/quote/create>.
2. Fill in the quote details until you get to the Vehicles page.
3. Add a new Vehicle and make sure to use the following data:
  - Bodily Injury Limit: $250,000/$500,000
  - Property Damage Limit: $250,000
4. You should see a validation error. Now, set the following data in the fields:
  - Performance: Intermediate
  - Tier: Preferred
5. Save the Vehicle.
6. Click on “Add vehicle”.
7. Fill in the VIN with a number of 11+ digits.

Expected result: Nothing happens and you can continue filling the form.
Actual result: An error under “Property damage limit” shows up saying: “Minimum Required Limit for Preferred Tier”.

883,14115,Add ALB Proxy integration shortcut,feature,jacob@britecore.com,,"## Summary
The ApiContribution resource currently makes it very easy for Lambda-backed services with the `LambdaProxyArn` parameter. We know that ECS via ALB is not going to go away completely, so we should provide the same convenience via a new optional parameter, `ProxyUrl`.

It should end up looking very similar to the LambdaProxyArn functionality. Instead of using the `type: aws_proxy` and hard-coded `httpMethod`, we should use `type: http_proxy` and use the same `httpMethod` as the method where the integration is being added. The `uri` is then simply the new `ProxyUrl` parameter.

940,14564,Exploration: Swapping Kinesis for SQS,chore,jacob@britecore.com,,"## Summary
Now that BriteEvents has its inputs and outputs abstracted, we can safely swap the underlying AWS infrastructure.

BriteEvents is currently using Kinesis as it's event ingestion endpoint. Kinesis has it's drawbacks, however. The biggest of which is pricing and scalability. We can get very similar functionality with better scalability and pricing (at least on the low-end of usage patterns) by using SQS instead.

This story is intended to be a time-boxed exploration of the complexity of the changes required to make this conversion. The biggest unknown at this point is what the VTL and APIG integration will look like to send events to SQS instead of Kinesis. The changes to the lambda handler and IAM roles should be relatively straightforward.

Enhanced Context Selectors will be converted at some point to the data structure defined in ch16746. From there it should be possible to generate code in a number of different target languages. This story should lay out the foundations to code generation, and to also implement basic generation capabilities specifically for Apache's Tinkerpop Gremlin.

See ch14666 and ch16746 for more details.

## Success Condition

Implement a code-generator class/module structure within the evaluation app. The created construct should receive as input an IR instance and output plain source code in the target language.

The pip wheelhouse bucket currently allows public reads. This is currently for convenience so that our python modules are easily installable in local environments as well.

I imagine we won't be able to lock this down without either some annoying changes for local development, or adding a CloudFront distribution on top of the bucket.

I am recording this requirement now while I am reviewing AWS Config Rule violations, but it will likely have other dependencies before it can be completed.

A few things about Page 3 (most of this is handled in data mapping, just explained here for background information).  
- If a policy has 4 or less vehicles on the policy, Page 3 would actually be Page 2.  
- The mock has a lot of information on it.  If it doesn't all fit on Page 3, it may need to go ont to the top of Page 4.
- Drivers Section - this is a listing of all drivers on the policy, their birthdate, Married, Gender and LIcense Number with all but the last 3 characters masked.
- The Forms and Endorsements section should list all the forms that are applicable to the policy, even any that may be listed out specifically later.  
- There are many forms that will print blank because their information is on the Dec, however, there are 5 forms that need their own section on the Dec if they are listed above because they need specific information listed for the form.   If any of these forms were not triggered, they should not be on the on the Dec.

Augusta would like to use the same table format for vehicles and coverages as they have on their Auto Dec today.  This part is not only used on the Dec, but also on the Policy Application and the Quote Summary.  It is a separate story because of the complexity of it.  It would block the first 1-2 pages of the Dec.

Details:
- This table can hold up to 4 vehicles.  If there are more than 4 vehicles, this table will repeat with the next 4 vehicles for as many times as needed until all vehicles on the policy are displayed.
- The top section is for vehicle specific data.  The Make, Model, Year, VIN, ISO Symbols, Rating Class, State & Territory, Driver Points, and Vehicle Tier are listed for each vehicle.
- The bottom section is for the coverages per vehicle.  
     - The first 5 coverages are policy level coverages.
     - Each coverage will list 'Per Person Limit, 'Per Accident Limit', Premium, and Deductible where it applies.
     - The remaining coverages should only be in the table if there is at least one vehicle on the policy with the coverage.
     - Towing & Labor coverage needs to have the option listed as part of the coverage label.  This may mean the Towing & Labor is listed more than one time with each additional one having a different option as part of the name.  Only Towing & Labor ones that apply to the policy should be listed.
     - Rental Reimbursement needs to have the option listed as part of the coverage label as well.  This may mean that Rental Reimbursement is listed more than one time with each additional one having a different option as part of the name.  Only Rental Reimbursement ones that apply to the policy should be listed.

1017,15734,Improve RDS Clone Docs,chore,jacob@britecore.com,,"## Summary
We had a successful use of the RDS Clone template. There are a few improvements and clarifications we can make to the docs to make it even smoother next time.

Namely, we need to mention:
* The template is only currently launch-able by Service Leads or AWS Admins
* Service Leads should use the `BC-CloudFormation-Role` IAM role to launch the stack
* The template at the end uses this template as a nested template. That is unnecessary and would require them to have S3 permissions to write their own template in the console. Instead, we should explain how to find the BriteCloud templates bucket and what the path is to simply put into the CloudFormation console.

1.  Create a ""New Version"" for the General Auto LOB via API.
2.  Navigate to Lines - General Auto and notice that the Line version is displayed and set to ""New Version.
3.  Navigate to Lines. Create a new line of business.
4.  Select the new line of business. 
5.  Navigate back to the General Auto LOB.

Actual behavior:  The version is set to ""Initial Version"". 
Expected behavior:  The ""New Version"" previously selected by the user should persist.

Test Video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LQHUyCbNtEfZMqwb8uDwNlxri0cq9x1M/view?usp=sharing

Per Aamir in regards to the current behavior:  ""It is intentional, since when you loaded the test LOB it overrides the activeVersion in the vuex store, and when new LOB loads it switches back to New Version since its does not have old info.. in future cookie can be used to persist selection.
Or set activeVersion per LOB in vuex store.""

UX agrees with this expected behavior.  Conversation with Laura here:

1042,1682,New Report - Lexis Nexis Contribution Report,feature,amy@britecore.com,,"*Business Goals*
As part of the agreement with using Lexis Nexis, Augusta needs to send Lexis Nexis a report back to them to let them know information from BriteCore which allows LexisNexis to have up to date information.

*User Story*
As a carrier, I want to sent a Contribution Report daily back to LexisNexis so that I can use their products.

*Success condition(s) (a.k.a. Acceptance criteria)*
This report will send back information for each policy that had activity during the reporting period.
**Definition of activity** (page 11 of attached IVSContributionSpecifications.pdf): 
When a policy is first written
When changes are made to a previously submitted policy
When a FIRSt loss payee notification needs to be sent to a lien holder or mortgagee
When making a correction to a previously rejected policy set (include any subsequent changes to that policy) 

Each policy set within the data file must summarize all the activity and at a minimum, consist of the following three basic records:
1.  One Policy Information Record (NP01)
2.  One or more Subject Information Records (SJ01)
3.  One or more Property Information Records (PR01)

Auto submissions will have the 3 listed above plus the 
1. Vehicle Record (VR01) for each vehicle covered by the policy
2. Miscellaneous Information Record (MR01) when applicable.
3. Policy Information Removal Record (DP01) - record length 36 bytes.  This isn't for a cancellation but for like removing test policies.

Around each submissions, there should be a header and footer row.  Also, each submission should start the day after the previous one ends.
**Header requirements** (page 31 of attached IVSContributionSpecifications.pdf):
Reporting Period Begin Date - CCYYMMDD
Reporting Period End Date - CCYYMMDD
Contents - Line of Business - 01 (Personal Auto)

Order of the records/Policies matter.  All policies are updated to the Current Carrier system in the order they are received, so the sequence of the policy records is important.  Example, if there is a cancel and rewrite in the same file, the cancel should be before the rewrite.

As listed on page 15 of the attached spec document, the fields required for Current Carrier Auto:
- Policy Number
- Insurance Type
- Change Effective Date (CCYYMMDD)
- Contributing Company AM Best Number
- Contributing Company Name (NP01 record)
- NAIC Number (NP01 record)
- Policy Holder Mailing Address (NP01 record)
- Policy Type (NP01 record)
- Policy Inception Date (CCYYMMDD) (NP01 record)
- Policy Period Begin Date (NP01 record)
- Policy Period End Date (NP01 record)
- Policy Holder and Insured Name (SJ01 record)
- DOB (SJ01 record)
- Relationship to the Policy (SJ01 record)
- VIN (PR01 record)
- Coverage Type (PR01 record)
- Individual Limit (PR01 record)
- Occurrence Limit (PR01 record)
- CSL (PR01 record)
- Vehicle Add Date (VR01 record)
Other fields that they encourage being added:
- DL Number
- DL State
- Vehicle Make
- Vehicle Model
- Vehicle Model Year

Testing file - First file would just be a header and trailer record only just to test that it goes through.  Usually there are multiple testing files that will need to be sent as the file has to have < 1.75% reject rate to be acceptable.

May need 2 files - 
1.  Initial book - active policies at the time.  Problem is that Augusta plans to move their current book over one month at a time as it renews.  They have about 1000 current inforce policies.  Shawn will have to get back to us on this since this isn't normally how they are used to doing it.
2. Daily files every day.

The Financial Responsibility Insurance Filing SR22 and SR26 Data Exchange.

SR-22, also known as SR-22 insurance or Certificate of Financial Responsibility (CFR), is a vehicle liability insurance document (verification) that is required by most state DMVs and is  filed by the car insurance carrier with the state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).  It is required when a driver was in an accident (at-fault without insurance), had a revoked or suspended license, repeated traffic offenses or too many tickets, or convicted of a traffic offense (ex. DUI).  An SR-22 is usually there for 3-5 years.

If an SR-22 is cancelled or expired, an SR-26 certifies the cancellation of the policy.

CMIC plans to build a centralized policy/account search page that will re-direct users to BriteCore or CMIC’s page depending on where that policy/account is located. In order to complete this they need to know which policies and accounts are in BriteCore as opposed to the CMIC legacy systems. This can be completed either via account numbering scheme, API calls to BriteCore, or an export file/report from BC to the CMIC system

User Story
As a web developer at CMIC I need to be able to determine if a particular policy/account is located in BriteCore or in CMIC’s legacy systems so that I can redirect agents from our central policy search page to the correct end-point.

Outstanding Discussion Points

Determine how to get policy numbers and policy UUID out of the BriteCore database
Is this available via API call? How often would this API get hit? Can CMIC cache the data?
API key was generated for Jordan to perform testing
May require a nightly export instead
Success Criteria

Through use of the API or a data export file/report ensure that Policy Numbers, account numbers, and Policy UUID are accessible for use in CMIC’s central search page

1066,14443,"Migrate Agency Experience tables to the dwh database, remove from britecore database",feature,ivan@britecore.com,,"# Problem

From Daniel Hebrink:

Can someone help me with understanding how the `agen(t)cy_experience_*` tables are used, or _if_ they are in use? I can only find `SELECT` statements in BriteCore, and there are no corresponding SQLA models for any of them. I see some uses in `api.v2.dashboards` for `agency_experience_summary`, `agency_group_experience_summary`, `agent_experience_summary`.

I am working on introducing a migration framework into BriteCore. Without matching SQLA models, these tables are trying to get dropped. If they are being used and populated some other way outside of BC code, please let me know.

Per my last thread, I have made an attempt to add SQLA models to `agency_experience*` tables (https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore/pull/11275). I’m having a bit of trouble though.

1. Tried adding an `id` column so the tables have a Primary Key. SQLA would not allow a table definition without one. Keying all existing columns together failed because of `TEXT`-type columns. These column types would have to be truncated at a specific length, but SQLA doesn’t appear to support this from what I could find. So adding an `id` seemed appropriate.
2. While adding an `id`, MySQL cannot auto-backfill or have a system default of `UUID`. So I have a postfix that adds the column and loops to add unique UUID values for every row. This stalled out in testing a couple of clients, so we more than likely cannot do this because the release process would break. Maybe adding a trigger would work, but I don’t know if there are reasons we have not applied triggers in the past…

Any ideas/help/suggestions here are appreciated @ivan. Please review my WIP PR when you have time.

The last time we met with Myles over the enhanced selector syntax, he gave us the idea to design an intermediate machine representation language to represent those enhanced queries in a way that is transparent to any frontend user-facing language we may end-up designing.

The idea resonates to LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), a data structure that represents compiled code in a format that is not suitable for machine execution but that is structured enough to support optimization generically regardless of the original source code language and regardless of the target machine code to be generated. 

For that reason, we will our data structure CSIR, or just the shorter form, IR.

The compilation pipeline for a selector expression would look something like the following:
* Capturing
* Tokenization
* Translation to IR
* Validation
* Translation to Gremlin

## Success Condition

* Design JSON-based IR to represent the source expression. All elements of an enhanced context selector need to be present in an IR instance.

# Description
## Steps to reproduce
1. Create a child Product with partially overridden Shared Calculations and Rate Tables.
2. Export Products hierarchy using `./manage.py export_product {root_product_name} -u`.
3. Flush DB using `./manage.py flush --noinput`.
4. Import Products hierarchy using `./manage.py import_product -t {root_product_name}`.

## Expected results
Partially overridden Shared Calculations and Rate Tables would be imported as `inherited`.

## Actual results
Partially overridden Shared Calculations and Rate Tables are imported as `overridden`.

## Screenshots/screencasts
<http://recordit.co/13ENAqPHxv>

In this screencast partially overridden Shared Calculation is imported properly because we have a temporary workaround for that which is going to be removed in this PR <https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteLines/pull/849> until we come up with a decent generic solution.

## Notes
Partially overridden entities require only Version model to be created. In order to do that, we need to distinguish between `added`/`overridden` and partially overridden entities.

## Environment

1172,17050,SPIKE: Research how DB snapshots play with SecretsManager::SecretTargetAttachment,chore,jacob@britecore.com,,"## Summary
We are going to be using SecretsManager secrets for our RDS clusters. We are also hoping to accept a snapshot ID to enable environment cloning and the gen 2 migration.

It is currently unknown how these 2  features will play together. AWS documentation does not say anything specifically about this interaction.

My hope is that the secrets manager target attachment will take over once the cluster is provisioned and will overwrite any password that came from the snapshot.

Please research this in the sandbox account to verify, then update ch12047 with your findings, so that it can be refined accordingly.

I am still seeing issues with cancel rewrite premium being double counted in Item Change by Shift Written Premium. For example these policies from the March 2019 XL Policy Bordereau had extra reinstatement rows:

- BAMDP-2019-001693-01-X
- BAMHO-2018-013188-01-X
- BAMHO-2019-012422-01-X

There were also quite a few policies from the January 2019 XL Policy Bordereau that needed adjustments. Maybe some of these were fixed by the last change in transaction logic, however when I pull the numbers today they are the same as before.

1201,11078,Document and port over BriteCore's Report Builder to a new repo/service,feature,ivan@britecore.com,,"# Description

For the gen3 report builder we will need to support at least all of the current features in the existing gen2 report builder (BriteData Report Builder). Currently there are some videos and a bit of doc around that but there is no single one document that contains all of the current features or how the internals of the report engine works. It's kind of mystical and you just need to dig through the code to understand what's going on.

The second piece to this is decoupling the engine logic for that into a separate repository. We want to support running running BriteData YAML reports from any other repo like BriteData Py Reports, something like:

```
from britereports.engines import britedata
df = britedata.run_report('Certificate of Mailing', from_date=None, to_date=None)
```

This does not include the frontend or UI, it's exclusively the Report Builder's logic and code in `lib/reports/engine.py`.

## Action Items

- Document current features of BriteData extensively (all of them with screenshots)
- Design tests, classes, etc for how we're going to port this over
- Create new repo BriteReports that will contain logic for report builder
- Port over backend using BriteData Py Report `data.get_data`
- Test with some complex YAMLs to make sure it works",,2019/01/25 11:24:18,,2019/04/24 8:09:28,2019/04/24 8:09:28,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,Backlog,,,348,BriteData,-5:00:00,Data

We need to deploy britedata-superset to AWS using CloudFormation templates right now it only works locally with docker. The big catch here is that we want to do it using serverless tech stack:
- Aurora serverless for the database
- Zappa, serverless framework or something else for the web server

 Apache Superset is done in flask so this should be possible. If we bump into major complications then we could do that using usual ECS, MySQL but would be really cool to get it working serverlessly.

1253,2608,Discuss: Should We Generate Temporary Signed URLs for User's Picture Attribute,chore,myles@britecore.com,,"## Topic
See the **Other Thoughts** portion of [this GitHub review](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore-UI/pull/223#pullrequestreview-107498653).

Essentially, of the following two options, which should we implement:
 1. Continue to expose a direct, publicly accessible URL for a user's profile photo.
 2. Utilize AWS Cognito's token generation hook to sign a temporary URL which will provide access to a user's photo for roughly the duration that their token is valid.

## Thoughts:

Option 1 is currently implemented and functional. Option 2 retains more privacy for our users. It would also allow us to retain flexibility on exactly where the profile image is stored by permitting us to generate the claim with each token instead of return a fixed value which is not easily changed.

We're most likely going to have to utilize the token generation triggers for other purposes (e.g.,  ch2195), so implementing this likely wouldn't cost us that much extra work in the long run.

There are two downsides I can think of immediately:
 1. It would never be safe to store the `picture` claim; it would be necessary to always read it from the token otherwise the image wouldn't be accessible.
 2. We'll have refresh tokens when we change attributes  for this to work.

## Priority
This task is low priority. We should be able to able to move to it pretty freely at any point in the future and while public, a user's image will be stored under an id unique to them and it's not possible to list the contents of a bucket, only directly retrieve them:

(bucket policy)
```
{
    ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
    ""Id"": ""Policy1522095480701"",
    ""Statement"": [

Three changes are suggested:

 1. Use regular expressions for valid keys instead of an array.
   *  Currently, the Code Input component (`src/modules/my-account/ValidationCodeInput.vue`) [accepts a `validKeys` prop](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore-UI/pull/203/files#diff-513fcd8b3716e1ee2e30b5a4b9f23418R25) containing a list of characters accepted by the input element. This same functionality can be offered more concisely by regular expressions while opening the door to some cases an array doesn't easily cover.
 2. The input type should be definable by the parent.
  * As discussed [here](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore-UI/pull/231#discussion_r177850361), for ease of use on a mobile phone, `type=tel` should be used for pure numeric input.
 3. Define keyset/input type pairs to make it extremely easy to use any typical implementations of this component.
    * To begin with, this probably just means numeric input with `type=tel` for the input.",,2018/03/22 18:12:26,,2018/12/07 16:01:26,2018/05/17 16:19:50,,3,FALSE,FALSE,BriteAuth - v2,,Backlog,9419,BriteAuth User Management v2,178,BriteAuth,-5:00:00,Auth
1256,2815,Discuss and implement a better way to get a data table's column slots,chore,delisson@britecore.com,,"As [discussed here](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore-UI/pull/184#discussion_r182874028), the `DataTable` component's method of getting its column definitions does work but does not seem ideal.

Myles' relevant comment:

**Option 1**
This [forum post](https://forum.vuejs.org/t/referencing-an-instance-of-a-component/5391) let me to the source of [vue-swipe](https://github.com/ElemeFE/vue-swipe/tree/master/src). This package solves this basic problem by reaching up to its parent and calling what is essentially a registration function.

At least when it comes to visibility (see [this review](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore-UI/pull/339#pullrequestreview-118921022)), the DataTable component currently delegates responsibility of managing data which it directly consumes to a child component which actually doesn't care about it at all.

Typically a component should delegate responsibility of data it doesn't directly care about or manage the utilization of to its parent. In the case of visibility for the data table, the table itself should probably just keep track of the set of visible columns.

Users can add/edit/delete parties from a claim, but to protect the integrity and legal discovery of a claim, there needs to be a system rule preventing party deletion once an action has been taken associated with the party. Payment, Note documented, or any action that creates a system tracking log.

**Rule -**

The Party can only be removed from a claim only if the selected party does not have any actions/notes or records associated with any part of the claim. Once a system record has been recorded, the party cannot be removed from the system. The party can only be moved to an ""Inactive"" status.

The type or role of the party does not impact the ability to remove a party.

1308,502,Vehicle-level items can't be rated until Policy-level data fields are entered,bug,grant@britecore.com,,"### Scenario

**Policy-Wide** risk type has an enum data field ""Limit 1.""

**Vehicle** risk type has an optional coverage ""Coverage 1"" that depends on Limit 1.

When on the Quote page for a Vehicle risk the user adds Coverage 1. However, it can't get a rate because it depends on Limit 1 (from the policy-wide section) and the field does not display on the page because it's not a Vehicle data field. Navigating back to the policy-wide section also does not display the data field. Coverage 1 never gets a rate.

### Implementation

We'll need to think about how this affects the Quote flow. 

There are a few options here:

* If the Vehicle risk has policy-level data fields that it depends on then **add them to a policy-wide section on the page.**
* Send the user back to the policy-wide section to complete any new fields that they need to get the vehicle item's rate.",,2018/01/30 17:31:45,,2019/01/24 15:15:34,2018/10/03 14:00:14,,5,FALSE,FALSE,"BriteQuote

The console is starting to get quite crowded, and it can be hard to find the resources related to your service.

ResourceGroups is almost an option, but it supports very few resource types.

We can look into IAM roles, but from what I have researched so far, there is no clear way to filter based on tags. There is the `ResourceTags` condition key, but there isn't very clear documentation on what kinds of resources support that. I know EC2 does, but we don't really use EC2.

Another option would be to explore the `CodeStar` CF transformation. When I played with CodeStar, it generated a role for the engineer that gave it access to all of the resources in the template.

Related to that one, we could also make a new custom resource that does a similar thing. Basically, you would just pass in a list of ARNS for all the resources in your template. Then we could make a role that has read-only access, but is limited to those ARNS. It could be tough to round up every ARN you would need though, especially with nested stacks.

1359,2816,Discuss and implement a better strategy for mutating row-specific state in DataTable,chore,delisson@britecore.com,,"As [per this discussion](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore-UI/pull/184#discussion_r171072815), The current `DataTable` implementation mutates the input rows directly any time it needs to keep state on each row (currently, it keeps selection state & row id). 

That approach does work, but is definitely not ideal. This story is for picking a better approach and implementing it.

Myles' relevant comment:

This solution isn't complete, but I think we cam solve this reasonably by delegating the actual selection behavior to the DataTable itself:

This approach improves things in two ways that I see:
 1. The data provided to the component is no longer mutated.
 2. Selection is delegated to the parent instead instead of mutating a prop (Vue would actually emit a warning about this if it was an object being mutated.

As this form _could_ be used to edit data from users other than the one on the page, the browser would offer to autofill incorrect data.

It is certainly useful though to have autofill in case it's really the user's data being edited. One option is to check that in the component and enable autocomplete selectively.

The [OpenID Connect (OIDC) spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), which [is utilized by Cognito for tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-with-identity-providers.html), defines a number of [standard claims in section 5.1](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims). These standard claims are included as default user attributes provided by AWS Cognito.

[Section 5.1.1](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AddressClaim) of the OIDC spec covers the address claim in extra detail since it is expected to be a JSON object with specific properties, including country.

Unfortunately, AWS Cognito is cramming the value we store for ""address"" into the ""formatted"" key of the address claim it generates. :frowning: 

## Suggestion
[AWS Cognito provides a trigger](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-lambda-trigger-syntax-pre-token-generation.html) which allows us to modify the token before it is issued. We should be able to utilize this trigger to set the address claim as we intend/according to the spec.

As described [here](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore-UI/pull/326#discussion_r190388701), it may make sense for the DataTable component to own the responsibility of updating a few select URL parameters such as:

 * The current page number.
 * The current search string.

While permitting the parent component to control this entirely does have some nice properties, it does also mean that every component that will need this functionality will have to introduce some very similar code.

Since most components which use the DataTable should probably produce shareable URLs, it may be reasonable to let the DataTable component itself own this responsibility.

This could be a little tricky where multiple tables exist on a single screen, but I think we could get around this by doing one or both of the following:

 * Accepting a prop which accepts a function and defaults to something that will work in the general case.
 * Accepting a prop which overrides the default names for these variables, including `null` or some other value which would indicate that this particular component instance should not touch the URL.",,2018/05/23 16:04:32,,2018/12/05 16:16:32,2018/12/05 16:16:27,,1,FALSE,TRUE,,,Backlog,9428,BriteAuth - Framework/Infrastructure - v2,178,BriteAuth,-5:00:00,Auth

1375,4637,PasswordValidator Cache is too aggressive,bug,myles@britecore.com,,"**Issue**
As soon as a password input component is displayed, the policy is retrieved and cached until the screen is refreshed.

The result is that a change in the password policy is not readily recognized. If password requirements are relaxed, a user should just end up with a more complex password than actually required (no harm done). If the password policy is strengthened, a user could be told their password is valid and then have Cognito reject the selection.

Here's a quick demo of the issue:
![2018-07-11 12.29.26.gif](https://api.clubhouse.io/api/attachments/files/clubhouse-assets/5a3c64e9-a53f-4d05-bf0f-a5c21841937e/5b48d8f3-01c9-4698-a4be-68eb6828cc75/2018-07-11%2012.29.26.gif)

Note that in this example I'm an administrator who changed the policy and immediately tried to view the change. However, other users could experience this same issue if the password policy is changed after they've loaded it.

To solve this problem, we'll need a mechanism to kill the cached value periodically.  All that said, this issue is relatively low priority as changing password policies and policies are both relatively rare actions  and both must occur in close proximity for this issue to arise. Furthermore, it's a very temporary issue which is resolved by a screen refresh.",,2018/07/13 12:01:24,,2018/12/05 16:20:08,2018/12/05 16:19:56,,2,FALSE,FALSE,Priority: Low,,Backlog,9430,BriteAuth - Validation v2,178,BriteAuth,-5:00:00,Auth

1410,9017,Explicitly name our lambda functions,bug,delisson@britecore.com,,"Background:

We got this issue trying to deploy BriteAuth to the panhandle account through Service Catalog:

```Failed to create resource. Create Operation on event SC-803812087273-pp-v634t3okcgw7y-AuthApiFunction-TS5E4Z6FU00R-Warming-Rule failed: An error occurred (ValidationException) when calling the PutRule operation: 1 validation error detected: Value 'SC-803812087273-pp-v634t3okcgw7y-AuthApiFunction-TS5E4Z6FU00R-Warming-Rule' at 'name' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must have length less than or equal to 64```

The lambda function warmer provider uses the lambda function name to build a rule name in CloudWatch, but that rule’s name is limited to 64 characters.

According to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_CreateFunction.html), function names are limited to 140 characters, so they are sort of unfit for rule names, especially after the prefix applied by Service Catalog. 

I see three easy ways to go about this right now:

1. Add a `Name` parameter to the warmer resource, but this just moves the explicitly naming issue from the lambda to the warmer, so it’s not great
2. Use something other than the lambda name to build the rule name, or compress it somehow. I really like the visibility that using the full name gives us, but a hash function for example would not collide with different function names and be guaranteed of a certain size. I don’t particularly like this alternative either.
3. Explicitly name our lambda functions. I recall seeing some discussion previously that stated we should leave naming for CloudFormation whenever possible, so I'm not sure this is the *best* solution right now.

In the name of getting the stack to deploy and without seeing any big disadvantages right now, we'll go with option *3* and name our lambda functions explicitly.",,2018/11/20 13:00:02,,2019/02/07 17:34:58,2018/12/07 15:09:24,,2,FALSE,FALSE,BriteAuth - v2,,Backlog,9442,BriteAuth - Deployment - v2,178,BriteAuth,-5:00:00,Auth

In BriteAuth (BriteCore Gen 3), a user's session expires much more readily than in it previously did in BriteCore Gen 2. Since impersonation information is part of the BriteCore Gen 2 session, this means the impersonation could stop unexpectedly due to an expired session.

We need to ensure that impersonation doesn't unexpectedly stop if a session expires while one user is impersonating another.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Users will impersonate another user and the impersonation action will not expire when their session expires / is refreshed by the Cognito tokens.
- Users with invalid cognito tokens must not be kept logged in the system when their tokens expire

**How to test this**
- Sign in to a BriteAuth-enabled site
- Start impersonating another user
- Wait until the session expires (1 hour?)

When creating a new user from the User Management module, it is sometimes the case that the 'Role' selection dropdown is filled with 'NO-AUTH'.

**How to reproduce:**

1. Add `optional: true` to the `firstNameNI` field in the Quote Flow YAML.

3. Fill in the ""First Name"" field and then clean it up.

The `fieldNameNI` should be empty, as it was just cleaned up.

The previous value for that field will still be there.

1488,12374,Map Named Insured to First Driver (blocked by AutoData Prefill),feature,amy@britecore.com,,"**Business Goals**
Currently have to manually enter both the Named Insured and Drivers.  When Auto Data Prefill connects in, it will use this Named Insured to look up other drivers, vehicles and prior carrier information.  Augusta has requested that this Named Insured be the first Driver and has the Named Insured checkbox checked.  Also, the address and the email is still connected to this Named Insured.

This may already be covered by Auto Data Prefill as it hooks in, but in case it doesn't, this story is documenting that this is how Augusta prefers it to be.

**Further Background**
In BriteQuote, we collect 1 named insured at the Policy level.  Mailing address is collected here as well.  Email is still required for that Named Insured.  Augusta can have up to 2.  We are adding a checkbox on the driver level to signal which drivers are the named insureds.  Rules will make sure that only 2 boxes are checked at a time.  

LexisNexis Auto Data Prefill will return a list of drivers using the Named Insured information.  The Named Insured (gathered at the Policy level and used for Auto Data Prefill) will automatically have their checkbox checked as the first Named Insured.  The Agent will be able to check up to one more.  

The 1-2 Named Insureds would need to map to BriteCore Gen 2 under Named Insured.  The address for the 1-2 Named Insureds would be the Mailing address entered in at the Policy level initially.  The address will be used for all drivers not Named Insured.

Augusta requested a new section under Contacts to BriteCore Gen 2 for the remainder of the Drivers.  That section would be `Additional Drivers`.  This is not the same as Additional Interests that is currently in Gen 2.  As for Additional Interests, Augusta's concern about adding Drivers under this is Augusta does have Additional Interests, but they are at the vehicle level and there are three of them - Loss Payee, Lessor and Trust.  Each of those need to trigger a document (CH 8857).  So the terminology is a bit confusing.

Mapping this way, the underwriter can see all the drivers, both Named Insured and non-Named Insured, in one spot.  We also need to be able to pull those drivers onto the dec later, so they need to be saved.

Created as a feature because Auto Data Prefill is not connected yet and not sure if this would be a bug if it is.

As a carrier, I want to map the Named Insured (name, address and email) used to call Auto Data Prefill as the first Driver and automatically check the Named Insured checkbox.",,2019/02/25 17:44:25,,2019/05/07 17:10:20,2019/04/26 7:54:13,,,FALSE,FALSE,"Augusta UAT Priority: Medium

1499,13099,Behavioral 35/36 - not working correctly,bug,amy@britecore.com,demian@britecore.com,"**Issue:**
Behavioral Rule 35/36 - Cannot have Collision without Comp.  This was tested in Quote Preview, however, it does not seem to be working correctly in BriteQuote.

This was part of 12341, however, it was discovered that this needs design input first.

**Expected Results**
When selecting Collision without having Comprehensive (Comp) already checked, Comp should be selected also.  If both are checked and Comp is unselected, Collision should be unselected as well.  Bug 12341 should be fixing the first part.  Unselecting Comp first while still having Collision is the part that is not fixed yet.

**Actual Results**
In BriteQuote, if check Collision without having Comp selected first, it does not also select Comp.  However, it does show the Comp fields (symbol and deductible) along with the Collision fields.  If remove Collision and leave Comp, it removes the Collision fields from Agent view.

Not in the video - but when I fill in the Original Cost of Vehicle and only have Collision checked, but Comp and Collision show a premium value:

The policy editor should be able to save network trips and to provide a smoother editing experience by validating the entered content against a common shared JSONSchema that defines what a valid serialized policy looks like for a given API version.

Initially, since we do not have an official way to share schemas from the backend towards the frontend, we can replicate it across codebases. I know that, to some extent, the schema is already replicated in three different places: backend codebase, swagger file, frontend codebase (Policy model definition). We will eventually work to normalize these into a single source of truth, but for now, let's focus on having that validation working.

## Success Conditions

* Validate policy content in the editor textarea using JSONSchema

Calls to process evaluation through the API are designed as batch operations as a way to encourage callers to batch ahead of calling and to reduce network latency. 

The API Lambda is currently responsible for handling the request collection, then process it sequentially - and for that reason, to increase processing latency linearly to the input collection size, which is not reasonable.

One way to improve performance would be to decompose the input collection into individual requests, call lambdas in parallel to handle each one of those requests, then map the parallel responses back into a single result respecting the input collection order. 

At least in theory that should approximate the final latency to that of the most expensive request in the set (as opposed to taking it to the combined latencies of all requests).

It does not make sense for `RecordAttribute` to have the property `required`. 

That property defines whether that attribute is required to exist in a certain context, and for records, all defined attributes must always exist.

That said, it still does make sense for `ActionAttributes.required` to exist, because a caller may be attempting to evaluate an access attempt with a certain action without really caring about that action's attributes, its defaults being good enough. That means the `.default` attribute is needed.

The rationale above speaks to a conceptual divergence between `ActionAttribute` and `ResourceAttribute`: they are not the same thing. Instead, ActionAttribute should be called `ActionParameter`.

## Success Conditions

* Remove `BaseAttribute.required`

1542,231,Policy Look up for multi-policy discount (needed for Renewals by 9/2020),feature,amy@britecore.com,,"**Business Goals**
Augusta would like the common discount of multi-policy discount.   This would be nice for go-live (Jan 2020), however, it has a workaround to allow the user to enter in the Policy number.  However, the logic to look up a multi-policy does need to be done by the time the policies renew (with time to do testing).  When policies renew, they need to be able to look up automatically to see if the discount would still apply (if the other policy is still active).  So this feature would be needed about 9 months after the initial New Business Live Date (approx Sept 2020)

Comments from Demian (1/7/2019):
From the Rules perspective - We will have to design that. The only part that is different from the current quotes rules is that it needs the whole customer information to check the amount of policies we have.
There are some ways I can think to make this work:
- Identify which data would be needed for this rules, quotes to send it as part of the payload. We would have to be cautions in the amount data we send, but maybe a list of policies with some basic information.
- Allow a rule set to define queries to make. So, a rule set, instead of only getting data from the payload, could make some queries to defined services, and with all the data evaluate the rules.

Then, we have to think when the rules are executed.. before creating the policy? Always? Will there be a button like ""Search for discounts?""

Followup Comments from Grant (1/17/19):
I think the way that we've built this in BriteLines is a good way to go. We define the multi-vehicle discount as a Field in BriteLines, do the multi-vehicle discount lookup in BriteQuote, and pass this information to BriteRules to evaluate rules, and pass it to the rating engine to change premiums.

**This story needs more discussion and this story will probably need to be broken up in to multiple stories**

This is what [Trello does](https://developers.trello.com/v1.0/reference#capabilities) in order to provide Power-ups the ability to hook into the UX. Trello really only has one page that these capabilities are provided on: the main Trello board page.

Since BriteCore is so much larger as an application I believe that we should scope our capabilities from service to page to specific area of UX.

The region code list included with the `PhoneNumberInput` component  includes many options. If a user does not know their region code (or thinks it must be manually selected), they currently must scroll through a huge number of options:
![2018-09-05 16.27.18.gif](https://api.clubhouse.io/api/attachments/files/clubhouse-assets/5a3c64e9-a53f-4d05-bf0f-a5c21841937e/5b904a51-dcd1-4116-9018-6cf546e23d08/2018-09-05%2016.27.18.gif)

## Suggestion
As a very quick improvement, I suggest that we consider the inclusion of the `filterable` property on the `<el-select>` used to drive this region code selection:

```diff
diff --git a/src/components/ui/PhoneNumberInput.vue b/src/components/ui/PhoneNumberInput.vue
index f3f356e6..e5058990 100644
--- a/src/components/ui/PhoneNumberInput.vue
+++ b/src/components/ui/PhoneNumberInput.vue
@@ -4,6 +4,7 @@
     <el-select
       slot=""prepend""

+      filterable
       placeholder=""Select"">
       <el-option
         v-for=""countryOption in allCountryOptions""
```

Although not a perfect solution, it becomes much easier to find the selection you're looking for if you know the region code or abbreviation:

1627,11119,Fetch Risk Group States on demand,feature,evelyn.pineros@britecore.com,valdir.stumm@britecore.com,"*Goal:*
To better use our backend APIs and avoid having huge responses being fetched.

*Problem:*
At this point, QuoteFlow [fetches a potentially huge Root Risk Quote](<https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore-UI/blob/master/src/pages/quote/QuoteFlow.vue#L74>) while initializing. It can easily go up to megabytes of data, depending on how many nested Risk Quotes the Root Risk Quote has.

This happens because [the API returns](<https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCore-UI/blob/master/src/api/quote.js#L41>) not only the Root Risk Quote, but also all its children Risk Quotes (including their Risk Group States).

There’s a relevant [Slack conversation](<https://britecore.slack.com/archives/CE5FS4S9H/p1548708127057100>) covering a possible solution to this, which is summarised below:

1. Change the getQuote API: make it return the full unified risk state instead of returning only the quote object. This way we won’t need to fetch the Root Risk Quote (and all its children) separately.

2. Risk Group State API: once we apply change #1, we won’t have the Risk Group States anymore, so the idea is to fetch those on demand using a new API that could look like:
```
GET /quote/{quote_number}/risk-groups/{reference_name}/state/
```

If possible, we should load it only once per risk group and save it to Vuex state, given that risk group states won’t change.

For older cars, they are returning in one field `combined_symbol` (comp/collision) and the separate fields return null.
![Clipboard 2019-29-01 at 10.44.56 AM.png](https://api.clubhouse.io/api/attachments/files/clubhouse-assets/5a3c64e9-a53f-4d05-bf0f-a5c21841937e/5c508308-7c79-415a-a0f5-b89b2517866d/Clipboard%202019-29-01%20at%2010.44.56%20AM.png)

As Andrey posted on slack:
1. According to `Vinmaster SIK 05-09`,

   - The Vehicle Series Rating (VSR) Symbol (position 30) reflects the relative Comprehensive and Collision loss experience of the vehicle. This field is populated for vehicles with a Model Year of 1990-2010, and the Symbols are based on the 27-Symbol Table.
   - The Price New Symbol (position 31) reflects the Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). This field is populated for vehicles with a Model Year of 1990-2010, and the Symbols are based on the 27-Symbol Table.
   - The combined VSR Symbol (positions 155-156) and the Price New Symbol (positions 157-158) each contain the numeric two-digit codes for the combined VSR and Price New Symbols. This field is populated for vehicles with a Model Year of 1990-2010, and the Symbols are based on the 27-Symbol Table.

If we look into `Vinmaster SIK 18.5`, then the VSR Symbol was splitted there:

   - The Comprehensive Rating Symbol (positions 73-74) reflects the relative Comprehensive loss experience of the vehicle. This field is populated for vehicles with a Model Year of 2011 and subsequent, and is based on the 75-Symbol Table.
   - The Collision Rating Symbol (positions 75-76) reflects the relative Collision loss experience of the vehicle. This field is populated for vehicles with a Model Year of 2011 and subsequent, and is based on the 75-Symbol Table.

If it is an older car with one symbol, the symbol should be mapped to both the collision symbol and the comprehensive symbol.  It is okay to use the same value in both and to have the value print on the Dec as two symbols, even if it came through as one.

- 5.7 has support for JSON column types, which we may want to use at some point.
- We are about to deploy separate AWS accounts for clients, and it will be more difficult to upgrade later.

To satisfy this PR we'll need to do the following:

1. Upgrade our MySQL version to 5.7 for development.
2. Switch our CloudFormation template to use Aurora MySQL 5.7 in production. [See this documentation](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/BriteCloud/tree/master/cloudformation/shared-templates/aurora-cluster) for help with this step.
3. Deploy the new DB in production.
4. Migrate WCF and Augusta's data to the new DB.

1639,11644,Driver Point Assignment,feature,amy@britecore.com,"nicolas.gomez@britecore.com
demian@britecore.com","**Background**
Per discussion on September 28, 2018, with Augusta, this is how  Driver Assignment should work:
- Agents can assign the Principal driver (there are exceptions to this)
- System needs to assign Additional/Occasional Driver (Behavioral Rules 25-27)

There can be multiple drivers on the policy that have points.  These points are set by the Behavioral Rules 13-21.a.  Each driver's points can only be on 1 vehicle even if they are primary driver on multiple vehicles.

Behavioral rule 22 is concerning when a driver is on multiple vehicles.  For example, Driver A is the only driver on the policy, has 2 vehicles and is primary on each.  Driver A has 3 points.  Those points can only apply to 1 vehicle, even if they are the main driver on both cars.  What Rule 22 is explaining is how to determine which vehicle those 3 driver points would apply since those points will affect the rates of the 2 vehicles.  Any additional vehicles that driver is primary on would just get 0 points.  

Rule 22 is NOT changing the assignment of the drivers and only applies when there are more drivers than vehicles and the driver is primary on more than one vehicle.  Rules state how to assign the driver's points to those vehicles the Driver is primary on.  The Agent doesn't assign which vehicle the driver's points go to, just who the primary driver is.  

In the case of a Driver being primary on multiple vehicles, their points would go on the newest year vehicle.  The other vehicles the driver is primary on would have 0 points for the Driver.  If the Driver is primary on multiple vehicles that are all the same newest year, then their points would go on the vehicle with the most coverages of those in the newest year and the other vehicles would get 0 for points for that driver.  And if that Driver is primary on multiple newest vehicles, and they all have the same coverages, then the points just go on one of them and the others get 0.

Example 1:
Driver A (primary on 2 vehicles) - 3 points.
2018 Ford F-150
2015 Chevy Tahoe
--> Driver A's 3 points go to the 2018 Ford and 0 points go to the 2015 Chevy.  Points go to the newest year vehicle.

Example 2:
Driver A (primary on 2 vehicles) - 3 points.
2018 Ford F-150
2018 Chevy Tahoe - more coverages (has towing and another extra coverage)
--> Driver A's 3 points go to the 2018 Chevy and 0 points go to the 2018 Ford because the Chevy has more coverages and they are the newest year.

Example 3:
Driver A (primary on 2 vehicles) - 3 points.
2018 Ford F-150
2018 Chevy Tahoe 
--> Driver A's 3 points can go on either vehicle because they have the same coverages.  So since 2018 Ford is listed first, 3 points go on that one and 0 points go to the 2018 Chevy.

**Background**
Currently, we have Loss Payee as a drop down on the vehicle.  Loss Payee is a Risk Type.  Augusta is concerned about the flow of having the Agent being in the vehicle and not having the Loss Payee filled out so the drop down would be empty.  If the Agent has to leave the vehicle to add the Loss Payee, they may not remember to go back and add it to the vehicle.

Also, there are 3 Additional Interests, Loss Payee being one of them.  Each of these types needs to trigger their own form.

3 Types of Additional Interest and the document they should trigger:
- Additional Interest - Loss Payee --> Loss Payable Clause
- Additional Interest - Lessor --> Additional Insured - Lessor
- Additional Interest - Trust --> Trust Endorsement

**Proposed change - per Steve:**
Change the drop down for Loss Payee to be just for Additional Interest and when one of the three are picked, that would trigger the document (per rules).  Also, if they pick `Additional Interest - Loss Payee` we would have additional fields at the vehicle for the Agent to fill out.  They wouldn't have to go back out of vehicle to do it.

1667,13096,DESIGN - No Collision without Comprehensive.,feature,amy@britecore.com,,"**Business Goal**
An Auto Policy cannot have Collision coverage without Comprehensive coverage.  You can have Comprehensive coverage without Collision.  This impacts all risk types.

This has been written up in Rules:
Validation 23 - Specifies that you cannot have Collision without Comprehensive. (you could have Comp w/o Collision)
To go a step further, we added in Behavioral rules 35 & 36 to help make sure the user doesn’t cause Validation 23 to be wrong:
35 - If Collision is chosen and Comp is not, automatically choose Comp.
36 - If Comp is removed and Collision is still on the quote, remove Collision as well.

Currently, the way the rules are written, they do not work.  Basically, if you have both coverages and go to uncheck Comp first, Rule 36 should uncheck Collision too, but Rule 35 is rechecking Comp since Collision is on there.  To the user, it looks like you just can't unselect Comp when you have Collision.  There is no message, just seems broken.

We need a decision on what changes to the quoting interface is the way to communicate the intent to the Agents.  Once decided additional user stories will be created (ex. ability to have Behavioral Rules return a message).

There are two ways so far that have been discussed:
- Remove Rule 36 and add a message to Rule 35 like ""Comprehensive is selected because you have Collision""  Send a message back from the Behavioral Rule.  (Currently only can do this with Validation Rules).
- Selective grey out the Collision until Comp is checked.  Grey out Comp while Collision is checked.

The login route receives an `identityProviderName` that's used to redirect the user to Cognito's `AUTHORIZE` endpoint hinting a specific IdP, so that the user can go straight to that IdP and not have to select one manually.

Right now, if you pass in an invalid provider name, the user will be redirected to Cognito's hosted UI which will display available login options. This is probably not desired, but it's not completely clear if just showing an error message is helpful as well. The UI might not know all identity providers configured in Cognito, for example.

This story is to discuss a way to handle this case and implement it.

BriteCore#8304 is really big and unlikely to be merged easily in its current state. We need to break it down to make it easier for the review team to approve it and move it forward.

This work has already started with BriteCore#10510 which does the initial groundwork:

* Change models
* Add columns to the database
* Add settings


---------

Cognito identity and access tokens expire after a while and must be refreshed using the refresh token, if available. As long as that token exists we should, every time the initial tokens expire, refresh them and update the session. It is very important that we also update the cookies, or else we run the risk of doing this on every page reload.

## Acceptance Criteria
BriteCore Gen 2 should still accept user sessions past the 1 hour mark. To test this, log into BriteCore and wait for the tokens to expire. When they do, navigate to another page and verify if the system is still allowing access. The cookies can also be inspected to check if the tokens have changed.",,2019/03/06 10:24:53,,2019/05/16 17:17:23,2019/05/08 14:33:36,,2,FALSE,FALSE,BriteAuth_Sprint_33,"[X] Check for the tokens' validity in the trust mechanism

BriteCore#8304 is really big and unlikely to be merged easily in its current state. We need to break it down to make it easier for the review team to approve it and move it forward.

This work has already started with BriteCore#10510 which does the initial groundwork:

* Change models
* Add columns to the database
* Add settings


---------

The way that Gen 2 did the ""New Quote"" button was to call a method that created a new quote and navigating to a specific URL after doing so. This is very incompatible with the idea of navigation items, which should be plain links that the user will request. We fixed this by adding a new API method that creates a new quote and returns the URL to it as a `302 Found` redirection. This way Gen 3 can do the same operation, just requesting that link.

## Acceptance Criteria
* There should exist an API endpoint in Gen 2 that takes no parameters and returns a `302 Found` with the location of the new quote's page.",,2019/05/13 15:56:40,,2019/05/15 10:36:28,2019/05/13 15:56:40,,2,FALSE,FALSE,,,Ready for Work,668,BriteAuth - Utilize BriteAuth in BriteCore,178,BriteAuth,-5:00:00,Auth

BriteNotes will eventually support the concept of external notes being sent, so whenever a note is created, it will allow users to define receivers and email addresses.

Not only that, but BriteNotes will also support ingesting received emails, and placing them as comments under a certain note stream.

This story is not about designing all external notes mechanics. This is about analyzing upfront our needs for additional constructs to represent notes, comments, and replies, and perhaps to use common constructs to represent different things.

We are deprecating our Custom::Secret resource. The primary current usage for this resource is to create a password for the aurora template. To enable service teams to stop using our Custom::Secret, and to promote best-practices, we should create the secret ourselves and simply output the id of the secret.

We need to maintain backwards compatibility in this case, since the engineering-dev environment has real work being done, specifically in BriteLines. So they need to be able to update the parameters to their cluster template on their own time.

This is an important one. Users can create and edit policies but the effects of such changes are unknown until an actual attempt is made to exercise the constrained or relaxed permissions.

At a high level, we need a mechanism that allows users to receive meaningful feedback on the impacts of their changes. Ideally, the feedback would happen in real-time, but we can certainly postpone that requirement.

Below is an idea for a machine we could build to provide that kind of feedback.

*Prebuilt Automatic Checks*

Users would prepare a ""test suite"" for the Policy comprised of a list of evaluation attempt objects that make sense to exercise the respective policy, and what the expected result would be for each evaluation attempt listed. The system would run those evaluations attempts automatically whenever the policy changes, compare the results with expectations, then show some visual indication to highlight matches/mismatches. 

Heads up that this functionality has some overlap to the Policy Simulator, a component that would allow users to explore functionalities and learn security mechanics by writing ephemeral policies and exercises to those policies, and to assess results visually. I imagine the same kind of visual construct that would support building Policy Simulator Exercises would support the construction of exercises for Prebuilt Automatic Checks.",,2019/05/15 11:28:13,,2019/05/15 15:29:20,2019/05/15 15:05:13,,5,FALSE,FALSE,BriteAccess .2 Sprint 9 (5/15/19 - 5/28/19),,Ready for Work,12702,BriteAccess UI:  Polished Policy Editor,10891,BriteAccess,-5:00:00,Access

I need a workflow that I can do this all at once, and then go back later and add exposure level loss details from the Exposure Summary Screen.  

Types of claims that would support this need are complex property and farm claims such as the Farm Claim example provided by Halifax.   Please see the following link for sample claim data for the Farm Claim resulting from a Tornado: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YxDLvrVmvGJTrE6mgyWHawdxSiN_KczkmUPMYJDsF98/edit#heading=h.esfxl3gdy4fc

An adjuster could use this workflow for adding an exposure to an existing claimant or adding a simple claim that doesn’t require a lot of detail at this stage.

Because of the limitations of Clubhouse formatting, the flow has been described in the following gDoc:

I need to minimize the number of times I am taken to a new webpage, the claims actions should be accessible by a pop-up module that allows me to complete common tasks that are completed on a claim.

Claim actions can be associated with the claim, a coverage assigned to the claim, the risk assigned to the claim, or a party assigned to the claim. 

* You can add an action to a claim but it does not have to be associated with a coverage, claimant/party or risk. 
* When you add an action to a coverage, claimant/party or risk, the action is automatically associated with the claim.

**Page View Requested -**

From the claim summary screen, the user can right-click or click an action button on a claim, coverage, risk or claimant/party, and the system opens a module action window to allow the user to document the action needed. 

Common Claim Actions Needed -

* Assign Adjuster to a coverage, claimant, or risk
* Reassign an adjuster to a coverage, claimant, or risk
* Add Coverage
* Add Claimant
* Add Risks
* Change the status of the claim or the coverage.
* Add a document/attachment to the claim, coverage, risk or party.
* Add a financial transaction to the claim, coverage, risk or party.
* Add a note to the claim, coverage, risk or party.

Upon completion of the claim action within the module, the system will document the action taken and auto notate the claim diary system for audit purposes.

*Possible Location of Coverage Actions -**

- Alpha
- Caseload

In addition, Supervisor should be able to sort by 
- City State: first sort by State, then by city
- Assigned Today, Ascending/Descending - this will be an important fort as adjusters will want to selected ascending/descending order when filtering on this column.  As a supervisor makes assignments they may want the lowest number of new Claims Assigned this  to be sorted in ascending order so the adjuster with the fewest claims assigned floats to the top.

Although the base Claims system will ship in v10.0 with default values in all of the fields, I need to be able to modify them to meet the unique needs of the client.  

MINIMUM REQUIREMENT: 

I will need to be able to easily find the fields that need configuration by searching for them by field/table name

I need to be able to easily type, paste, or import the values that will appear in the drop down list or table

OPTIONAL: 

I would like to also like to be able to easily find a field from a tree structure organized by functional area and screen.

As an example of the tree structure: 

- FNOL (Functional Bock)
  - Personal Auto (LOB)
   - Step 1 (Screen Name)
     - Reported By: This is the field name that will have the values that need to be modified

When in the Reported By screen area, I need to be able to easily type or paste in the data elements that will appear in the drop down list

ADVANCED SETTINGS: 

Ideally I would like the values in the drop down list to have a data on them when they were added, modified, and who changed them. 

I would also like the values to have an effective date of when they will be valid options to be selected and appear in the drop down list

Finally I would like to have business rules under the conditions that a value in a drop down list is visible, not visible, selectable (vs greyed out)

There is no java-specific documentation. Really, the only “requirement” to get picked up by BriteLogs is that you log JSON and have a `service` key.  This is what the `django-britecore` formatter uses under the hood to see some other common log keys: https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/bc-logger/blob/master/bc_logger/base.py#L135",,2019/05/08 12:37:05,2019/05/15 13:02:20,2019/05/15 13:02:20,2019/05/15 13:02:20,,2,FALSE,FALSE,"BriteRules:  Medium Priority

1844,13951,Calculation failing on subsequent vehicles in rate preview.  500 error received.,bug,chelsea.ux@britecore.com,vikas.yadav@britecore.com,"For reference this is scenario 2 from the following slack conversation:  https://britecore.slack.com/archives/CAKLMEP2M/p1553547292005200

I was able to recreate in the engineering-dev.britecore.com environment using the Commercial Auto POC product.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create new rate preview.
2. Fill out required fields in Policy risk group.  Be sure that the ""Number of Earned Exposure Years"" is set to a value of 3 or less in order to recreate this issue.  This is due to another bug which will be reported separately.
3. Add a new Driver risk group; fill out driver information (averageDriverFactor is based on driver age and driver points).
4. Add a second new Driver risk group; fill out driver information; make sure one driver has the Owner boolean set to Yes and the other has it set to No.
5. Add a few PPT and TTT risk groups and fill out information (do _not_ add Vehicle risk group; that is old/not being used and will be deleted).
6. If you click on one of the already-added coverages on TTT or PPT (like Liability coverage) to view the rating details you’ll see a whole list of missing references - A is missing reference B, B is missing reference C, C is missing reference D, and so on down the list until something is missing reference `averageDriverFactor`, and the last missing reference is “`averageDriverFactor` is missing reference `averageDriverFactor`”.
7. Re-enter the Policy risk group and add the “Tools and Equipment” coverage to the policy. I’ve temporarily added some item calculations to this item that resolve some calculation queries, including averageDriverFactor. If you click on that coverage to view the rating details, you’ll see averageDriverFactor resolved there.
8. Exit the Policy risk group and enter one of your PPT or TTT risk groups; it doesn’t matter which one - it could be the last on the list or the first on the list or somewhere in between
9. When you enter whichever PPT or TTT risk group you’ve decided on, the items previously missing premium/references should now all have premium. When you click on the item to see rating details, there won’t be any missing references.
10. Exit that PPT or TTT risk group. Enter another PPT or TTT risk group. This risk group won’t load; it’ll spin endlessly. If you have the network tab open, when you try to load into one of those other TTT or PPT risk groups you’ll see a 500 error getting the response of `detail    Failure running the ""manualRateQuery"" calculation (bc.risk.children.sum(calculations.manualRate)): unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'decimal.Decimal' and 'float'` - even though that’s the same query that the _first_ PPT or TTT risk group you loaded into is using successfully to rate.

BriteCore#8304 is really big and unlikely to be merged easily in its current state. We need to break it down to make it easier for the review team to approve it and move it forward.

This work has already started with BriteCore#10510 which does the initial groundwork:

* Change models
* Add columns to the database
* Add settings

There are new modules in BriteAuth that will be added and also replace some pages from BriteCore Gen 2. For this story we'll need to both add the User Management module to the module list and also change the My Account links to point to the new My Account page, for all roles.

* BriteCore Gen 2 should take the user to the Gen 3 My Account page whenever they click on the ""Account Information"" button and BriteAuth is enabled.
* BriteCore Gen 2 should have a new module that leads the user to the Gen 3 User Management module. This module should only be shown when BriteAuth is enabled.

Currently, policies are passed ahead to IAM without being simplified or having variable bits turned into literal constants. Instead, they are encoded to a format the matching engine understands.

The problem is, not all the selectors envisioned by the syntactic enhancements we are planning can be easily encoded in a format that IAM understands.

The plan here would be for policies to be pre-processed so they become simpler to encode.

A new account was created and moved into the Client OU. This fired the correct event and triggered our lambda function to add the stack-set instance.

Unfortunately, the stack-set instance failed to create successfully.

I will then want to  be able to provide additional filters to the list to identify a set of claims  and select one or more claims for bulk assignment.

Provide the ability to filter the list of claims by one or more of the following attributes:
- Claim Number
- Policy Number
- Claimant/Insured Name
- Line of Business
- Loss Cause
- Language Preference
- Complexity
- Loss Date Range
- Reported Date Range
- Loss Location Address (City and State)
  - Select one of the following from a drop down list before entering City/State: Insured State, Loss State, or Vehicle Location State
  - Then from a multi pick list, select the state (s)

**SORT**
Provide the ability to sort based on ascending/descending values of each data element


**GRID ACTIONS**
Provide the ability to select 1 or more claims to have a grid action performed.  Grid Actions include: 
- Assign to Adjuster

This functionality is used by some client developers to actually create reports with pandas using the csv files provided from this Export functionality.

We need to be able to do the same (download CSV files for DFs from s3) with BriteData ETL.

The same feature is available via an API v2 endpoint,

## Current behaviour

If a user downloads caches with current Export DataFrames feature those will contain the following information:
- Non Prepared DFs contain all rows and history
- Prepared DFs without facts/dimensional (agencies, policies, lines) contain all rows and history
- Accounting and claims prepared DFs have all history
- Prepared DFs with other facts contain current month (item range, return premium, commissions, etc)

## Other tools

- Dremio will allow downloading all data sets as CSV but limiting to 1 million or certain amount of rows
- Other tools allow selecting a range for facts so that user can get Claims as csv file for 1 month, 1 day, 1 year, all historic, etc

todd.robertson@loudounmutual.com

Loudoun is using the old AR Aging report, need to check if we already solve this with revamped Accounting logic (new ETL) or not.

======

We have recently concluded our first accounting audit while being on Britecore and our auditors expressed concern about the way the AR aging report is being portrayed.

Their concern is there is not a ""Current"" bucket in the AR report. For example, the AR report on 1/31 should show February Renewal balances in a ""Current"" category. Theoretically they are not past due yet however they should be accounted for in our AR balance.

Attached is our 1/31 AR report.

Also per our Auditor another client has reported this in the past. Here's their commentary regarding the issue. They reference using the PITCOC report which doesn't seem to be present in our system.

We simply took the Premiums In The Course Of Collection (PITCOC) detail by policy number and did a VLOOKUP on the Aging Report detail to ascertain those amounts that were billed out in BriteCore actually showed up as amounts due on the Aging Report. The items that had no match are what totaled the $334K of “Plus Amounts Billed Not On Aging”. 

Theoretically, if we send out a bill and it’s included in the PITCOC, then one would (in our opinion) find those amounts on the Aging. More so, the Aging is simply our PITCOC bucketed to reflect it’s due date in terms of 30 day increments. If the PITCOC actually had the due date of each item on it within the detail tab, we could age it ourselves, yet that doesn’t really fix the report that was created in the first place for the community. 

Also noticed today, that if we have an insured on a quarterly installment and has $4,800 due 60 days from today, yet that same insured received a late notice and a $25.00 charge for being late with the last quarterly payment, that $25.00 forced the future AR into the 60-89 day bucket, which in our opinion is incorrect, the $25 is definitely in that bucket, yet the $4,800 is “Current”. When we waived the late charge, the amount disappeared all together from the Aging as it wasn’t due for 60 days which leads us to our next question. 

Would you be able to confirm something for us? Within the code for the Aging Report, does it compare due date to run date, and if so, if the due date is zero or greater days from the report date, then it ages it - correct? This would work in most cases, however it would leave off most of our future billings off the report that have been billed out up to 60 days in advance of the actual due date. So we are thinking the code actually needs to be updated to reflect a qualifier of >= (-60 days) from the run date of the Aging Report rather than >=0. 

Those items would show up in a “NOT YET DUE” column rather than the “0-30 Day” column or just have a “CURRENT” column that includes all of the items from -60 to 30 days, either way works. Bottom line, were are hoping that both the Aging Report and the PITCOC reflect the exact same amounts in total, if we bill it, then we age it too.",,2019/03/01 15:52:20,2019/05/06 12:50:27,2019/05/15 10:36:12,2019/05/08 12:56:08,,1,FALSE,FALSE,"Reports Sprint 1

According to initial exploration, execution times for `iam.SimulateCustomPolicy` revolved around 60-100ms. Attempting the evaluation of a single request using the API end to end is taking more than 1sec at best. The current end-to-end latency baseline is not good, despite any parallelization optimization and it needs to be improved.

A second look at the evaluation flow through the lens of xray revealed delays are, for the most part, caused by SQL statements used to load domain definitions from the relational database into the application. By optimizing DomainRootDefinition data loading latency is likely to drop considerably.

In a conversation with Kujtim this morning, he exposed his team vision on how security constraints should apply to people at different permission levels in a dynamic way depending on a certain LoB association.

According to Claims modeling, users have a direct relationship to several different combinations of ClearanceLevel + LineOfBusiness. That kind of relationship is not a concept directly supported by BriteAccess, but because BriteAccess is rather flexible in how policies are associated to actors and roles, I still think the model may support that use case as it stands.

Per Trisha via email: Screen prints are attached - 
1. The colors look ok on the main screen. However, it looks not so great on the landing page. See WausauLandingPage attachment.
2. We’d like the app to be our Grays and Reds, so the blue box is kind of icky? See WausauLandingPage attachment.
3. Might be nice if the View Policy Manage Payments Methods / Auto Pay and File a new claim link were very dark Gray and the Blue box was also dark gray with white lettering? See WausauLandingPage attachment.
4. Can we get the documents and payment method blue box changed? Dark Gray with white is fine (light gray when not highlighted is OK). See WausauDocuments attachment and WausauPaymentMethod attachments.

This story is for the header elements needed for the screen.

The adjuster dashboard header needs to have only one main element:

* Adjuster Dashboard

Function Request -Each element that is displayed would be a drill down clickable link... 

**Adjuster Dashboard Display Elements -**

* Open Tasks Assigned to Adjuster
* The number of claims assigned - (Click takes the user to a detailed table view with all claims assigned.)
* The number of Claims Closed this week - The calculation for this element is based on the current work week. This counter would reset every Sunday. (Click takes the user to a detailed table view similar to the search results page, with all the claims/coverages assigned and closed. See Rules for Closed Claims.)
* The number of claims closed this month - The calculation for this element is based on the current month. This counter would reset the first day of every month. (Click takes the user to a detailed table view similar to the search results page, with all the claims/coverages assigned and closed. See Rules for Closed Claims.)
* The number of unassigned claims. The unassigned claims element is a clickable link to a data table results page similar to the search results page. This landing page also allows the adjuster to assign claims.

Rules for ""Closed Claims"" - The rules for the claims that are counted as ""closed"" must meet the following criteria - The search for closed claims will include the Claim and Coverage Status.

* If the claim and all coverages are closed, and the adjuster is assigned to one of them, then it would be counted in this data element.
* The adjuster does not need to be the assigned adjuster to the claim - If not assigned to the claim, the adjuster must be assigned to a coverage on a claim -
* The coverage that the adjuster is assigned to must be in a closed status -
* The claim itself does not need to be in a ""Closed"" status -
* If the adjuster is assigned to multiple coverages and 1 of them is still open, then it is not counted as ""Closed"".

###Claims Search - Searchable Fields -

When the Search function is searching the system it should search the most common data fields for claims:

* Claimant Name
* Claimant Name Alias (nicknames)- (Don't believe Contacts supports this yet)
* Insured Name
* Claim Number
* Coverage Type (Coverage A, Coverage)
* Policy Number
* Policy Type
* Loss Date
* Adjuster
* LOB (Personal Home, Personal Auto, FarmOwners, etc.)
* Risk Type (Vehicle, House, Building)
 * VIN (Depends on Risk Type)
 * Address (Depends on Risk Type)
*Labels: Litigated, Represented, SIU, Salvage, Subrogation

The search will result in a list of records in the search results view that can be viewed/grouped by any of the data table displayed fields.

Clicking on a record in the data grid should navigate to the claim summary screen of the claim selected.
 
The data grid should provide hyperlinks to different screens on the Claim File
* Link to Claim Summary
* Link to Financials of the claims
* Link to Notes on the claim

Search Results View (Card Summary) - 

Display the results data in an uncollapsed, card summary view. The uncollapsed card view will be the default view for each card. The user can collapse the card summary view if desired.

![Screenshot 2018-07-30 22.44.44 copy 3.png](https://api.clubhouse.io/api/attachments/files/clubhouse-assets/5a3c64e9-a53f-4d05-bf0f-a5c21841937e/5b609477-3094-47bc-8403-f316cf657df0/Screenshot%202018-07-30%2022.44.44%20copy%203.png)

If a claim is displayed that has more than 3 coverages associated with the claim, the card summary should only show 3 coverages, and give the user the option to expand the view to see the additional coverages.

![Screenshot 2018-07-30 22.44.44 copy 5.png](https://api.clubhouse.io/api/attachments/files/clubhouse-assets/5a3c64e9-a53f-4d05-bf0f-a5c21841937e/5b60999f-05d8-4de8-a850-6bcf6ce163d6/Screenshot%202018-07-30%2022.44.44%20copy%205.png)

**Pagination -**

If the search results in > than 10 results, the results view should add table pagination functionality to allow the user to browse through the additional page results.

![Screenshot 2018-07-30 22.44.44 copy 4.png](https://api.clubhouse.io/api/attachments/files/clubhouse-assets/5a3c64e9-a53f-4d05-bf0f-a5c21841937e/5b609540-ff11-475d-87d9-6736e4b1b3f7/Screenshot%202018-07-30%2022.44.44%20copy%204.png)

**""Ellipsis"" Button to display additional data -**

After the search function returns the results, the table should display as many fields as possible for screens greater than 1400 pixels. If additional fields need to be displayed, the data table should display an ""Ellipsis"" button to allow the user to select and show additional fields.

![Screenshot 2018-07-30 00.06.34 copy 4.png](https://api.clubhouse.io/api/attachments/files/clubhouse-assets/5a3c64e9-a53f-4d05-bf0f-a5c21841937e/5b5f6638-4a97-4346-b3b0-c7b860428c60/Screenshot%202018-07-30%2000.06.34%20copy%204.png)

* If the search is performed with an exact claim number, one result is returned.

* Each row in the search results section can be clicked to be selected.

* If the search is performed using broad criteria (Policy Number, Claimant's Name, Claimant's Phone Number, Loss-Date, Vehicle ID or Notification Date)  multiple results matching the search criteria might be listed. The user must select the appropriate record. 

* The user should be able to search for a claim based on Partial Name, Claim Number, Policy Number and Phone Number.

  - Last 30 days - Number of Exposures  assigned Last 30 days

  Behavior- Clicking the label will display the visualization supporting the label

**Behavior Navigating the Trading Card**

Section 2- When you click on “Currently Assigned” (should be relabeled to “Claims Assigned”), the pie chart displays the Line of Business Type as a percentage of all Claims assigned to the adjuster

When you click on “Exposures Assigned”, the pie chart now displays the Coverage Type as a percentage of all exposures assigned the adjuster

Section 3- Labels should be changed to: Assigned Today, Assigned Last 7 Days, Assigned Last 30 days.  When the user clicks on “Assigned Last 7 Days”, the graphic should show a bar graph with the number of claims assigned in the last 7 days.  When the user Clicks on “Assigned Last 30 Days”, the graphic should show a bar graph of the last 4 weeks and the number of claims assigned each week

FUTURE: We may change this graphic so the bar graphs in section 3 will be associated to whether or not the user is focused on Claims or Exposures in Section 2.


**Selecting Trading Card**
 - On the top right of the card there is a check box. Adjusters can click this to select the card for a comparison view.  If 2 or more card are selected, clicking on View 5-Comparison will display cards with this box checked.

**Assign Selected Claims Button**
- At the bottom of the Card, there is an Assign Selected Claims Button.  This is to support the workflow where an adjusters selects 1 or more claims in section 2 and then clicks on the Assign Selected Claims button of the Trading Card in order to assign the claims to the adjuster

The response time multiplies as soon as the preview fields are filled. The request times out when a second risk from PPT/TTT risk is added due to the rating API taking more than 30 seconds to complete (AWS Lambda timeout).

The possible reason for this could be the fact that PPT/TTT risks have risk items which reference parent/policy risk calculations which in turn reference other calculation which run aggregation queries on child risks. Thus making it longer to resolve.

This is related to ch13951.

We foresee the CloudFormation template `Service.yaml` growing large enough that it makes sense to split it into several `yaml` files that get merged by some mechanism. Currently the BriteEvents repo is using the `build-yaml` command but it might be better to explore using the native Includes transform by AWS, or nested stacks like BriteCloud does.

BriteCore#10367 is an amalgamation PR containing all changes required for BriteCore Gen 2 to use BriteAuth as its authentication system.

That PR is composed of multiple sub-PRs all merged into it. Those sub-PRs are all attached to stories, but those stories are marked as Completed because the actual work has been done.

We still need to merge those PRs into `upstream/master` though, and that's no small task.


---------

Users will only see modules in the navigation bar that they have access to. Half of the work is already completed in BriteCore-UI, but the other half belongs to BriteCore Gen 2. For this, there must be an api endpoint that returns the currently logged in user's permission information for top-level modules.

Part of the work is done in [delissonjunio/BriteCore#3](https://github.com/delissonjunio/BriteCore/pull/3), but there are some fixes in other PRs:

- [delissonjunio/BriteCore#5 - Add release info endpoint and remaining navigation links](https://github.com/delissonjunio/BriteCore/pull/5)

>KeyError: '[15 17 14 16 20 18 19] not in index'

When running this with BriteData Py Reports dependencies that works fine. So we think the issue is with numpy and pandas versions:

BriteData Py Reports:
```
pandas==0.19.2
# No explicit numpy pinned version
```

BriteCore gen2:
```
pandas==0.22.0
numpy==1.10.4
```

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install britecore gen2 requirements in a python 2.7 virtual environment:
```
(.venv) britecorio@Macorio:~/git/britedata-py-reports(master○) » pip install -r ~/git/BriteCore/build/requirements.txt && pip install -e .
```
2. Run report with
```
(.venv) britecorio@Macorio:~/git/britedata-py-reports(master○) » COMPANY=velocity python bin/run_report.py -r ""Portfolio Report Contract""
```
3. Watch if fail:
